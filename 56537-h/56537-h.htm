<p class='pindent'>It is inconvenient to have to bear with personal
deficiencies—troublesome and disheartening not to
possess all the senses and the faculties which are
demanded to enable man to compete with his fellows
upon equal terms; and it requires philosophy
that we do not repine when we find ourselves in
any respect, either physical or mental, compelled to
stand aside in the unpleasant attitude of being an
exception to the general rule. It is true that the
march of science is able, to a considerable extent,
to obviate corporeal default. Eyes are constructed
so well as to deceive the eye, although the constructed
eye is not yet so perfect that we shall hope
to see with it far into the opacity of mill-stones.
Legs are manufactured more symmetrically beautiful
than the majority of real legs; and the skillful
artist will, if you are only tall enough, modulate you
into a figure which might put an Apollo to the blush.
But the steam leg, in its swiftness of locomotion, is
as yet no more than a dream of the visionary; and
we may pad ourselves into muscularity as much as
we please, without gaining a particle of power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are aware that by the aid of spectacles he
who would otherwise be always stumbling over the
dog, and tripping in contact with other people’s feet,
periling his precious countenance by rude collisions
with every species of obstacle, may contrive to see
his way through the world in comparative clearness.
But science has not perhaps succeeded to the same
extent in the work of metaphysical regeneration;
nor do we know that any man’s geese have as yet
been fully converted into swans, though he may
think them progressive creatures in the scale of ornithology,
and likely to reach a higher position than
has been attained by former members of the race.
It is theoretical, we learn, with the phrenologists,
and probably practical also, to a greater extent than
the world is willing to admit, that there are processes
whereby the neglects of dame nature may
at least be partially counteracted and repaired, so
that “bumps” shall be raised, where depressions
exist, and some degree of potency be secured in
those “organs” which were originally faint and
feeble; just as the muscular fibre is strengthened
by exercise, and as our agile capabilities are increased
by a judicious practice of the thews and
sinews on which activity depends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, while we hope for the sake of humanity in
general, that these assumptions will fully bear the
test of experiment, it must yet be conceded that
education fails somewhat in this regard; and that
in thinking, as in dancing, much depends upon the
configuration of mind and of body with which we
were endowed from the outset. The phrenologists
are right in the belief that training has its advantages;
but there must be a basis on which that
training is to proceed, or the result will be such as
cannot fail to lead to serious disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For example, and in the way of parenthesis, it
would be a parlous difficulty to teach the innate
craven to plunge valiantly onward at the desperate
head of a forlorn hope, or to hurl himself recklessly
upon the sharp and bristling array of a forest of
hostile bayonets. You may debate the question if
you are so inclined, insisting on it vehemently that,
in honor’s view, there is no essential difference in
a case like this, between a glorious death and the
triumph of a victory, and that the most disastrous of
the two is infinitely preferable to an age without a
name, yet, our life on it, it will prove that your
friend of the weak nerve, and of the nonchivalrous
temperament, is not to be talked, by the most persuasive,
into any relish for cold steel, or into any
decided fancy for the reception into himself of certain
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
intrusive pellets of hot lead. Nay, Ciceronian
eloquence would be wasted in the endeavor to induce
him to come to the conclusion that it is much
better for him to be extended face upward on the
ensanguined plain, after the fashion of the “grinning
honor” of Sir Walter Blount, than to find himself
sound in body, but without a single sprig of laurel
to his name, snugly enfolded in the blankets awaiting
a call to breakfast. Nature, you will observe,
has denied to him the perception of the romantic
and the poetical. He has no desire to be posthumous
to his own reputation. To such a one, the
hard knock is simply a hard knock, unmitigated by
transcendental embellishment; and renown has no
part in the plain arithmetic of his calculations. He
values life by its admeasurements—according to the
number and length of its days. So give it up at
once—there is no sun—of Austerlitz or of any other
place—that can ripen this man into a warrior, or
tempt him to enter into fierce competition for the
wreath of glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus—musically—we find that people “without
an ear,” do not often take the lead in operatic
performances; or, if they do participate, that the
operatic performances are not particularly benefitted
by their interference. The querulous and
fretful—do they acquire the resources of patient
fortitude? Not often, so far as our experience extends;
and we do not know that the simpleton,
school him ever so much, is likely to obtain distinction
for himself as a philosopher—nay, he is often
furthest from it at the very moment when he imagines
himself a great deal wiser than his neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such as these, as well as others who might be
mentioned, have no foundation on which the deficient
“bump” is to be elevated; and, as a general
rule, it is just as well to abandon as a “bad job” all
effort to render them distinguished in the display
of those faculties which form no part of their primary
constitution. The superstructure that may
be raised on an insecure soil, must of necessity be
weak and “shackling;” and all the military education
that can be bestowed on the poltroon, will not
avail to prevent an ill-timed manifestation of that
species of plumage which obtains ignoble renown
under the epithet of the “white feather.” It has
been in him probably from his birth, that he must
locomote in a direction contrary to that in which
“the nettle danger” uprears its ugly front; and, under
these circumstances, the impulse to retrograde
travel will burst all the artificial and conventional
bonds which have been devised to drive it into the
teeth of the battery. It was the design of nature
that our friend should run; and who will venture
to stand antagonistical to nature?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a mere flight of fancy, no doubt, into the
illimitable regions of hypothesis, but we should very
much like to see the day when a Bumpological art
shall be matured, and a practical science of Organology
be brought into operation. Then there will
be some use in the knocks about the sconce, which
are now so wofully wasted; and when we shall be
driven into frenzies, the manifestations of our wrath
will become really beneficial to those on whom they
may chance to be bestowed. Then we should find
the rationale of corporal punishment—a thing not
to be whirled about in random kicks and cuffings;
but to be so applied as to develop that very bump,
a deficiency of which, in the offending party, has
so raised our vengeful ire. Such, perchance, is the
latent reason why we are so anxious to maltreat
those who are not disposed to obey our behests, as
well as the true motive why it is an impulse of our
nature to chastise the enemy. Education would
thus be revolutionized, and the Art of War would
be brought within the range of the directly useful
sciences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to descend at once to the facts that are before
us, it is a blessed thought to believe that by a wise
system of tuition, the small uncertain spark of a
virtue may be breathed into a steady flame; and if,
infirm of purpose as so many are, they could be
strengthened into a surer aim by due attention to
the feebler parts of character, none, we are sure,
could be found to regret it; and so we are, and we
intend to be, full of respect to this phrenological
idea, which might, we think, be somewhat more
carefully engrafted upon systems of educational improvement,
so that the mere appeal to the memory
might leave room for the analysis and development
of the moral being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We should go to school upon a different principle
then; and probably it may not be a useless waste
of imagination to reflect a little upon the novel
scenes that would then be presented in the halls of
the academy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son Bob, Mr. Professor—this is Bob, sir,
trying to hide himself behind the door—stand up,
Bob, and behave like a man—Bob, Mr. Professor,
hasn’t got any pride, and has the smallest quantity of
dignity. He’s always letting himself down, and
never tries to hyst himself up—likes the raggedest
boys the best, Mr. Professor, and prefers the company
of the sweeps to going to the nicest of tea-parties.
Bob always feels flat in genteel society,
does Bob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—I comprehend—a very common case, indeed;
but curable—take Bob, Mr. Simpkins, and
touch him up in the region of self-esteem. Don’t
be afraid—we’ll make Bob—you’ll have to call him
Master Robert then—as proud as Lucifer, in a week
or two. When we send him home, he will hardly
speak to his own father, and he wont own any of
his relations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here is Peter, sir, and Sam—nice boys as
ever was, only they don’t care nothing for nobody,
and will have it all their own way, which is apt to
be the wrong way, if not a bad way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! ho! knock up a bump in the region of approbativeness,
so that they may quit thinking for
themselves, and always want somebody to think for
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
“Please, Mr. Professor, our Tom appropriates
and conveys—sugar, sir, or pennies convertible to
sugar—he bones, sir, and he filches, sir, whatever
he can lay his blessed little hands upon, the darling;
every thing is fish that comes to Tom’s net.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so—Tom has not yet got beyond the first
principle of human nature, which impels us to help
ourselves to whatever we want—the application
must be made to Tom, sharply, just where his conscience
ought to be. Bump up a conscience for
Tommy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disrespectful, who, in some way or other, are
disposed to make faces at their superiors, would
require to be rapped rather soundly in and about
“veneration;” and we are not now to be told that
a smart blow on the eye is sure to awaken vociferous
displays of the faculty of “language.” For
him who comes too late, which is bad—or stays too
late, which is worse—what could be better than a
forcible appeal to “time?” And if a boy—your boy,
or any other body’s boy—cannot be easily made to
see the essential difference between his own selfish
will and your authoritative behest, you have only
to perform for him a tune upon his slumbering
organ of “comparison,” and you shall have music,
you may depend upon it. If the same rebellious
individual is slow to discern why he should obey,
lend him a smart fillip upon his “casualty,” educive
of the why, and provocative of the wherefore; and
if you yourself cannot discover the point of a joke,
taking the fact for granted that it is a joke which
comes to a point—some jokes, like some people,
come to nothings—depend upon it that your “wit” is
beginning to lose its edge, and is getting to be somewhat
rusty in the method of its operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one, we presume, will venture to deny that
“cautiousness,” well rubbed and roused, has a
tendency to keep our fingers out of the fire; or that
an inflammation of our “combativeness” will give
us joy in the facing of our foe. But what, let us
ask, what is to be done, if, like the peculiar one who
now comes under our special notice—what is to be
done, if in all the qualities which go to make up our
mentality, we have not one scintilla of self reliance
and expectation, and are like</p>

<p class='line' style='font-size:1.2em;'>TRIBULATION TREPID,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A MAN WITHOUT A HOPE!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>You see, the case is in every way a hopeless one—for
Tribulation Trepid never had a hope. He has
no more idea of what you mean by a hope than a
blind man can understand what you are talking
about when you speak of colors. Hope!—how do
you go about it—how do you begin when you want
to hope? The first principle of hopefulness is not
resident within the confines of the craniology of
Tribulation Trepid; and, therefore, from the very
moment of his birth, up and down—but more down
than up—poor Tribulation Trepid has been lost in
despond and in despair. Who ever called him
“Young Hopeful?” It would have been the very
heartlessness of cold derision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If in the adventurousness of youth—for the
earlier stages of existence form a perpetual exploring
expedition, and an unceasing voyage of
discovery into all sorts of holes and corners, to the
constant annoyance of those who do not appreciate
the march of mind in its primary manifestations—if
then, at this interesting period, Tribulation Trepid
undertook to exercise his limbs, and to gratify his
curiosity by climbing up the chair, or ascending the
table, that in this way his knowledge of the laws of
gravitation might be increased, and his power of
self-reliance extended, and if, thwartingly, at such
perilous moment, as too often happens to be the
case, the usual maternal caution fell upon his ear,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tribby, Tribby, what are you at? That child
will fall and break its good-for-nothing neck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tribby, of course, did fall—he was sure to do it—only
suggest the worst of the alternatives to his
mind, and, lacking hope to sustain his trembling
limbs, he dropped at once into the fell catastrophe.
He took it for granted that it must be so; and so it
was. The great secret of successful adventure is
confidence—a fixed faith in the potency of your
star; and he who is deficient in this belief, will find
it much better to remain at home, or to “go ashore,”
than to tempt the chances of the storm. He, in
truth, seeketh a shipwreck, who is not assured of
his own buoyancy; and that man marches to an
overthrow, whose mind is always dwelling on the
probabilities of being beaten. He alone triumphs,
who disdains to entertain a doubt of his own invincibility,
and thus compels fortune to perch, whether
she will or no, upon his daring banner. But such was
not our Tribulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Tribby, take this pitcher down to Susan,
and be sure you don’t fall, or I’ll box your ears,
you Tribby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the doctrine of pains and penalties, which
until lately formed the basis of all education—sound
whipping and sound teaching having heretofore
been identical—one would have thought that, with
such a threatening over his head, Tribulation Trepid
would not have dared to treat himself to a luxury
so expensive as the species of tumble now referred
to. To slip down stairs by himself is wicked
enough in any child, when we reflect upon the uproar
which every child is apt to create under these
circumstances. But to slip down stairs, including a
best pitcher in the gymnastic operation, to the exceeding
detriment of the crockery, is an offence not
to be excused at the judgment-seat of the good
housekeeper. It is a sin which cannot be pardoned
or overlooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now mind—don’t you fall and break that
pitcher, Tribby, as you always do,” was the pursuing
admonition to our child of wo, as he entered
upon the labyrinthine convolutions of the dark
stairway—but just then—did you not expect it?—cr-a-a-sh!—bimble—bumble—rub-dub!—Tribby
has
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
achieved his descent by a short hand process, and
lies vociferously prone upon his back at the landing-place,
environed by the fragments of the ware. We
are not satisfied that it mended the matter at all,
and we are quite sure it did not mend the pitcher;
but we presume it was a satisfaction, if not to both,
at least to one of the parties involved; and a satisfaction
is something in this unsatisfactory state of
existence; and so Tribulation Trepid received his
promised reward—“I’ll teach you,” and so forth—causing
his auricular appendages to reverberate for
an hour or two, and likewise to be comfortably
warm for at least the same space of time, affording
him both his music and his caloric at the lowest
possible rate; though it can scarcely be said that
his hope underwent any considerable degree of
augmentation by the process.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Tribby Trepid doesn’t know his lesson, I am
tolerably well assured of that,” said the teacher,
glancing significantly at his rattan—for Tribulation
Trepid underwent his share of schooling when rattan
was lord paramount in the academic groves,
and served, as it made the schoolboy “smart” in
more senses than one, to counteract, on the part of
preceptors, the baneful influences of sedentary life,
by affording wholesome exercise in the “dusting of
jackets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Tribby’s hope not being strong in the faith
that he would prove thoroughly conversant with his
lesson, when brought up to the test of actual experiment,
though he was acquainted with it passing
well when he left home, the announcement of this
foregone conclusion in the teacher’s mind, coupled
with certain tingling remembrances connected with
rattan, drove all other lessons from his desponding
brain; and he was executed accordingly, to the infinite
relief of Mr. Switchem’s dyspeptic symptoms,
and to the marvelous increase of the aforesaid
Switchem’s appetite for dinner. And so, reproof,
condemnation and rattan being inevitable, why
should Tribulation Trepid annoy himself by the previous
pain of toilsome study? He did so no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t know ’em if I do; and I shall be whipped
whether I do or not,” said Tribby, and he forthwith
bowed himself down to that which appeared
to be the inevitable, allowing hope to be crushed
beneath the lumbering wheels of a Juggernaut of
fear.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>Hope on—hope ever. There is nothing in this
world so valuable as hope. The thing hoped for,
precious though it be, is perhaps less of a blessing
in itself than the state of mind which convinces us
that by the proper effort we are able to obtain it.
Better is it to be full of hope than to have triumphed
in the pursuit of all that man regards as most desirable.
Hope is richer than a diadem. Hopefulness
is a perpetual banquet—a feast that never
cloys; and he who has around him the glowing
atmosphere which hope alone can bring, has no
need to envy the successes that others have
achieved. His dreams surpass reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tribulation Trepid has no hope. If there
were a germ of it at the outset of his career, it was,
as it were, trampled down and buried by a conviction
steadfastly impressed, that, if others could succeed
he was sure to fail; and therefore, he did fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did he mount a horse—oh! Tribulation Trepid
will be thrown from the saddle, as a matter of course—and
he was thrown. Did he undertake to leap
the brook—the discouraging idea seemed to arrest
him midway that he could not do it; and Trepid
emerged dripping from the wave. And so it was,
and so it has been, throughout the life of Tribulation—such,
it may be, is the secret why the lives of so
many of our kind present an unbroken series of
disastrous failure. They lack the inspiring voice of
hope. They knew it would be so; and so it is.</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>It is a melancholy thing, moreover, to have to do
with the family of the Trepids. In the endeavor to
encourage them, your own hopefulness seems to
fade away; and the more you labor to elevate them
and to push them forward, the more heavily, and
inertly, and listlessly do they fall back upon your
hands. They are convinced that it is of “no use
doing nothing,” and they tamely suffer every competitor
to pass them in the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just so it is with the lugubrious individual now
before us, who invariably puts the worst possible
face upon every matter, for the simple reason that,
as in the reflection of a mirror, every matter wears
the worst possible face to him; and as he looks at
matters sadly, despondingly, just so do matters return
the glance. He sighs over matters, and groans
over matters. He walks through the streets with a
longitude of visage and a mournful down-drawing
of the corners of the mouth that would be neat and
appropriate at the funeral of his best friend, but
which are sadly out of time and place at every
other moment; and he feels assured always that it
is going to rain—if not to-day, certainly to-morrow—that
is, in case a shower is not wanted. Otherwise,
it will never rain again—it has forgotten how.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beware, then, how your sympathizing nature
induces you to accost Tribulation Trepid in the highway,
unless you are proof against the contagious
influences of sorrow, and are firmly fixed in the confidence
of your own hope; for it seems to afford a
mournful satisfaction to all the Trepids to bring
others down to their own melancholy level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may try,” say they—“no objection to any
body’s trying—but it’s not often that trying comes
to any thing. Whatever it may be, it will never
answer—we never knew things to answer. Things
never answer nowadays,” with various other
assurances of a like enlivening nature. Beware,
then, of the effect of contact with the Trepids, unless
your nature is of that sanguine sort which bids
defiance to the chill, and has hardihood to sport
itself safely in December’s snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
“How are you Trepid? How do you feel to-day,
Mr. Trepid?”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“A great deal worse than I was, thank’ee—’most
dead, I am obliged to you—I’m always worse than
I was, and I don’t think I was ever any better.
I’m very sure, any how, that I’m not going to be
any better; and, for the future, you may always
know I’m worse without asking any questions; for
the questions make me worse, if nothing else does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Trepid, what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, I tell you, in particular; but a great
deal is the matter with me in general; and that’s
the danger, because we don’t know what it is.
That’s what kills people—when they can’t tell
what it is—that’s what’s killing me. My great
grandfather died of it, he did, and so will I. The
doctor’s don’t know—they can’t tell—they say I’m
well enough, when I’m bad enough; and so there’s
no help. I’m going off some of these days, right
after my great grandfather, dying of nothing in particular,
but of every thing in general. That’s what
finishes our folks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Tribulation Trepid has now got under
way in reference to his bodily health, it may be as
well to suffer him to explain himself in the matter
of his pecuniary relations, which are in quite as
bad a condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but, Trepid, how do you come on otherwise?
Why don’t you go into some sort of business
and keep a shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep a shop!—what’s the use of my keeping a
shop? If I keep a shop, nobody would ever come
into it; and if they did come in, they wouldn’t buy
any thing. Didn’t I try once, and nobody came,
because they said I hadn’t enough of an assortment?
Ketch me! Why did they not buy what I had, instead
of trying to coax me to get things, which they
would not have bought after all? Me keep a shop!
Yes, to be sold out by the sheriff—I’m always sold
out—don’t I know it beforehand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Apply for a situation did you say? Nonsense!
Aint they always very sorry—if I had only come
sooner, or if they had only know’d of it before—isn’t
that always the answer? Could I ever get
anywhere soon enough, or before somebody else
had been there, and had gathered up all the good
things that were agoing? Don’t talk to me about
applying for a situation. It’s almost as bad as trotting
about to get an office. ‘Bring your recommendations,’
say they; and by the time you’ve got
your recommendations, oh, how sorry they are, for
such a nice man as you, only the place is filled
already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a great mind never to try to go anywhere
any more, after situations—somebody must sleep
there all night; for, however bright and early I get
up of a morning, there he is; and I might have had
the place if I had been in time, as if that was any
comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as for trying to borry money of people,
which is a nice easy way of getting a living as a
gentleman could desire, if you’ve a pretty good run
of business in that line, I never could do much at
it, somehow or other. I never could take the
moneyed people by surprise. They seemed to
know what I wanted as soon as I looked at them,
and they were always very sorry, too—everybody
is very sorry to me—but they had no cash to spare
just now, and just now is all the time when people
don’t want to lend. No—nothing is to be done in
that line unless you can take them by surprise, like
a steel trap; and I’m not quick enough for that
operation. There’s never any money when I’m
coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give up—yes, if nobody will leave me a fortune,
and no rich widow will marry me, I’ve a great
mind to give up, and see what will become of me
then. I suppose something must become of me:
though I hardly believe it will, for nothing ever become
of me yet. But of this I’m sure, there’s no
use of my trying to get along by myself; and I’ll
just sit down by the side of life’s turnpike and wait
till something goes traveling by to get me along.
But I guess I’ll have to wait a good while; for the
place will be occupied—they’ll be very sorry, to be
sure, and they’ll wish they had know’d it in time;
but there’s no room left.”</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'>It will thus be seen that Tribulation Trepid adopts
the expectant method of treatment, as the course of
practice best adapted to the peculiarities of his case.
He waits for something to “turn up” in his favor,
because he lacks force, faith and hope to urge him
onward to energetic effort—for, in the collapsed recesses
of his trembling heart, he does not really
believe that any thing favorable will “turn up” for
him. Such turnings up never have occurred for
his special benefit. All his turnings have been
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
turnings down; as the turnings of this world generally
prove to be, unless our own shoulder is so
applied to the turning as to induce it to turn in the
proper direction. And this brings us to the great
query of all queries—the unsolved problem in our
social theory—what is to be done to help him who,
by nature or by education, proves to be unable to
help himself—what measure of relief is to be passed
for the benefit of the sinking family of the Trepids,
as they stumble down the depths of disaster?—Gentle
reader, and most sagacious friend, if you
should think of any, pray announce it betimes; and
in return receive a position among the most distinguished
of the benefactors of the human race.
Cheer, if thou canst,</p>

with this cold pen and sluggish ink. I own I love
Right Angledom. After the bustle and <span class='it'>randomness</span>
of life in New York—its straight ways, its quiet and
its monotony, are refreshing. I love the Quakers
too, with their delicious repose of manner—their
low, lulling, musical voices, and their simple truthfulness
of character and conversation. Their ‘ways
are ways of pleasantness, and all their paths are
peace.’ But I must confess to, now and then, a feeling,
I cannot say of home-sickness—for I, wanderer
that I am, have no home, unless it be in your heart,
and in some few others, a <span class='it'>precious</span> few, indeed—but
a feeling of regret, a pining for the past; for the few
true and pure spirits to whom I have dared reveal
myself, who <span class='it'>know</span> me thoroughly, faults and all, and
who love me the more for those faults; because love
and pity come <span class='it'>together</span> on their divine mission from
the gate of heaven, and walk hand-in-hand, twin
children of God, ever tender, and beautiful, and sad,

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thee knows,’ Mary, as a lovely Quaker maiden

weakness of mine, and has been the cause of
many troubles to me. I recollect once in New York
going to a party, which I afterwards heard was
made <span class='it'>for me</span>—made expressly to introduce me to
some distinguished authors—and just see, Mary,
how badly I behaved; see what a wayward, naughty
lion I was. Had I only <span class='it'>known</span> then, as I afterward
did, the kind interest that my host took in me, I
should have been so happy, so social, so delightful;
but as it was, with my usual want of self-confidence,
finding myself among strangers, I felt my heart, like
the pimpernel on the approach of rain, coldly
shrinking and shutting up, leaf by leaf, until I became
a statue of <span class='it'>lead</span>; and on my introduction to
those writers, whom I had all my life been eager to
see, and whom, if I had only been sure that they
would let me, I could have loved at once. I replied
in monosyllables, so coldly, so drily, that they left
me, surprised and repelled; and my dear, kind, disappointed
host, afterward said, in reply to some
encomiums by a friend—‘Yes, I suppose she is all
that, but you must allow that she is very eccentric.’
<span class='it'>Am</span> I eccentric, Mary? Am I any thing but foolish
and timid, and sensitive to a ridiculous degree?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now it was this shrinking of the heart that I felt,
when I first took possession of a large, and at first,
somewhat dreary room in a Philadelphia boarding-house.
The sister of a dear friend, then in Washington,
called upon me, and with a single magical
sentence, like a gleam from the lamp of Aladdin,
warmed, and furnished, and lighted up the chamber,
till it seemed a home even to my lonely and sorrowing
heart. She simply said, ‘Oh! this is the room
that Sophy had!’ The following impromptu will
show you how fervently I felt the change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Mary! if only my dream-opera could play
on through life, uninterrupted by the coarser or
commoner cares of every-day existence—if the
charm of that music, inaudible to others, to which,
when I am let alone, my spirit moves, gliding or
dancing as the measure chances to be swift or
slow, might not be broken by the discord of reality,
how light would float the fairy hours, led by that
weird and wondrous melody, from ‘night to morn,
from morn till dewy eve.’ But often, just in the
midst of my heroine’s most impassioned reply to
my hero—the bell rings for dinner—or our little
Lily-belle wants her robe arranged—or rosy, roguish
Mary insists upon playing that she is my mamma
and that I am her youngest and naughtiest responsibility;
and, after all, the glee that our three loving
hearts play and sing together, with now and then a
coo from the cradle from our little dove, our precious
‘Picciola,’ as an accompaniment—if less ethereal—less
artistic—is quite as sweet and more
spirited than the dream-music that Fancy plays in
the air for me. To be sure, I have to be punished
and put in the corner by my little tyrant, rather
oftener than is convenient or agreeable, and to spell
hard words, that I eschewed in my vagrant school-days
some—forty years ago!—if we count time by
‘heart-throbs,’ as Festus bids us, I have lived longer

<p class='pindent'>“I broke that chain of thought, attracted by the
peculiar grace of a compliment paid by a gentleman
to a very lovely woman, who is sitting near me,
bending a pair of superb Spanish eyes and a graceful
Psyche-head over a suspender, on which, beneath
her fairy hands a wreath of exquisitely delicate
flowers is growing and glowing; all too daintily
for the heart it is meant to chain—since that heart
is man’s⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of so important an event as the capture
of Mr. Mowbray was not long in traveling to
Mrs. Blakeley’s. One morning, as she and her niece
sat at work together, the butler rushed into the room,
betraying considerable agitation. We have already
alluded to his pomposity and affectation of high-sounding
phrases; another foible, the desire to play
an important part, sometimes got the better of his
discretion, as in the present instance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve just heard such news, Missus Blakeley,”
he exclaimed, breathlessly, wiping the perspiration
from his face. “It’s completely admonished me.
I’se run all de way from de head of de abenue,
where I heard it from Jim Benson, who listed wid
de British, and is now going home on a furbelow;
a berry respectable person he is for a Tory and a
common white man. In his new uniform he looks
almost like an officer, I insure you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the old man paused, overcome by the rapidity
of his utterance. Both Mrs. Blakeley and her
niece understood his peculiarities too well to interrupt
him, but they looked up smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such news!” he began again. “I hope young
missus won’t faint. Be sure, such things must recur;
but to think it should happen to Mr. Mowbray—Lor’
save us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate, at the mention of her father’s name, turned
pale, and could no longer endure the speaker’s prolixity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter with my father?” she gasped,
“Is he dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, missus—only taken by de Tories. But
dey say he is to be hung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of Kate’s ghastly face stopped the officious
announcement—but it was too late; with a
shriek she fell to the floor. At this spectacle, the
old slave, struck with sudden remorse, cried, wringing
his hands,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have killed her. Oh, Lor’!—oh, Lor’!—will
she ever survive again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have only made her swoon by your hasty
announcement of this terrible news,” said Mrs.
Blakeley, sternly. “Run and send her maid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long before Kate was restored to consciousness.
Meantime, Mrs. Blakeley learned from
old Jacob all he had to impart. Of her brother’s
ultimate fate she could scarcely entertain a doubt.
She well knew the character of that bitter warfare.
The orders of Lord Rawdon, the then superior
officer of the royal army in South Carolina, had just
been repeated, that all who had once signed the protection,
yet subsequently been captured in arms
against the king, should be summarily executed.
The sentence of Mr. Mowbray, according to old
Jacob’s report, was already issued. Mrs. Blakeley
was scarcely less shocked than her niece, but her
fortitude was required to sustain Kate, and she
struggled to appear composed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go to Col. Watson at once,” were almost
the first words of Kate, on recovering her senses.
“Surely he will not refuse us. He was but lately
your guest—how can he then deny your prayer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! my child,” replied her aunt, with tears in
her eyes, “war converts men into fiends, and dries
up all the kindlier feelings of the soul; but especially
in a civil war like this, no such thing as friendship is
acknowledged. Have you forgotten the fate of Gabriel
Marion, the neighbour of the general—youthful,
beautiful, unoffending, the pride of that old man’s
heart? He was taken in a skirmish, and, as soon as
recognized, told to make ready for death. His
prayers for a respite—for paper to write to his
uncle—for time to make his peace with God, were
alike denied him.” She shuddered as she continued.
“They made him kneel on the highway, and then
basely murdered him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they will not, they cannot murder my father
thus. The men who did that foul deed were Tory
outcasts. Col. Watson has a kind heart; he <span class='it'>will</span>
spare my father’s life.” And Kate, clasping her
hands, addressed her aunt supplicatingly, as if on the
words she might speak hung her parent’s existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Blakeley could not reply for some time for
weeping. Twice she essayed to speak: twice tears
choaked her utterance. At last she shook her head
mournfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say not so—you do not mean it,” cried Kate,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! alas! my darling,” sobbed Mrs. Blakeley,
clasping Kate in her arms, “I would as willingly
hope as you; but there is no hope. Was not solicitation,
influence, promises, every thing exerted to
save Col. Hayne; but to no purpose? They are inexorable.
Did not the general say, in refusing a
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
pardon, that if it were his own brother, he could do
no more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words the full truth of her father’s situation
seemed for the first time to break on Kate, who
hitherto had hoped that aid from some quarter, her
own prayers, or other influence, might save his life.
During the time Mrs. Blakeley was speaking, the
unfortunate girl gazed with stony eyes upon her,
every feature rigid, her arms motionless and set,
hanging by her side, and her head slightly advanced,
with half parted lips, listening eagerly. Even when
the speaker ceased, only a vague sense of what she
said seemed to rest on Kate, and she murmured vacantly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No hope!—none, did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Blakeley shook her head, mournfully. Her
own heart was swelled to bursting; that stony look,
those rigid lips, made her tremble for the reason of
her niece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No hope!” whispered Kate, in those thrillingly
low tones that are more eloquent than all the accents
of despair. “Oh, just Heaven!” she exclaimed,
suddenly elevating her voice; and she
raised her outstretched hands on high, “wilt thou
see this foul injustice done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here the pitch of horror to which the unfortunate
girl had been wound up, proved too much
for a frame already weakened by preceding agitation,
and she suddenly fell back, rigid and paralyzed,
in another fainting fit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day, and part of the night, Mrs. Blakeley
watched over her niece. Toward midnight the
sufferer sank into a slumber. On awaking in the
morning, wan and haggard, she seemed only the
shadow of her former self; but she had gained composure;
though in the quivering lip, and the eye
that filled unconsciously with tears, might have been
read the agony of a breaking heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though Mrs. Blakeley did not allow herself
to hope, and thought it her duty to bid her niece
discard all expectation of the prisoner’s pardon, she
nevertheless resolved to do every thing that could
be done to induce Col. Watson to save Mr. Mowbray’s
life, or at least to grant a respite until head-quarters
could be heard from. Accordingly, she
spent the hours of the night, after Kate, <a id='stup'></a>stupefied
alike by exhaustion and by narcotics, had sunk into
slumber, in writing to Col. Watson. She also
penned a hasty epistle to Major Lindsay, beseeching
his interposition; for though Mrs. Blakeley was
well aware of his pretensions to the hand of her
niece, she thought this no time for morbid delicacy.
These epistles being indited, and confided to the
hand of a trusty servant, with orders to spare neither
whip nor spur until he reached Col. Watson’s quarters,
Mrs. Blakeley, toward morning, sought her
couch, almost as much exhausted, both physically
and mentally, as her unfortunate niece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning broke in that once happy mansion
as on a house of death. The shutters were half
closed, as if to exclude the light, and the servants
stole noiselessly to and fro, speaking in whispers
scarcely above their breath. The morning meal
remained almost untouched. Kate could eat nothing;
and often set down her teacup, while her eyes
filled with tears. Mrs. Blakeley, spite of all her self-control,
was nervous and trembling. The old butler,
who remained in the room, often turned his back,
and brushed the honest tears from his eyes; for
though unwilling to betray his emotion, he was unable
to prevent it. Even Mrs. Blakeley’s pet grey-hound
seemed to know and participate in the grief;
for, instead of rushing up to his mistress boisterously,
when she came down stairs, as had been his wont,
he walked slowly and sadly toward her, looking up
appealingly into her face, as if assuring her of his
sympathy. The same dull pantomime was gone
through with when Kate entered, and made her
lip quiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Blakeley had informed her niece of what she
had done, and said that nothing now remained but
to wait an answer to her letters. Kate, however,
begged that she might be allowed to go to Col.
Watson’s head-quarters to see her father; and
though Mrs. Blakeley strove to dissuade her from
this purpose, believing that the interview would
only harrow up unnecessarily the feelings of both,
filial love prevailed, and Kate extorted a lingering
consent that they should set forth as soon as the
heavy, lumbering carriage could be prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was during this delay that the galloping of a
horse arrested her ear, and Major Lindsay was seen
to alight on the lawn. During the moment that
elapsed before his announcement, Kate had time to
indulge in a thousand wild speculations. Hope
whispered to her that Major Lindsay had procured
the pardon of her father, or else come to announce
a reprieve. Breathless and trembling, she did not
wait for his entrance, but hurried to the door of the
parlor. Mrs. Blakeley was almost equally agitated.
Her first supposition was that Major Lindsay had
received her note, and hurried at once to their aid;
but a moment’s reflection satisfied her that time
enough for this had not elapsed. She concluded
then that he had hastened, on his own suggestion,
to comfort them; and she advanced to meet him as
eagerly as Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lindsay met them at the door. He started
back at the sight of Kate’s wan face, for never could
he have believed it possible that human agony could
be so <a id='for'></a>forcibly depicted on the countenance; but,
recovering himself he advanced eagerly, and clasping
the hand of each lady in his own, looked from
one to the other with a smile, not gay yet encouraging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bring us good news, I know,” said Kate, turning
deadly pale, and then flushing to the forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” said he, with marked emphasis.
“God grant it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God grant it, indeed,” faltered Mrs. Blakeley, in
reply, the blood going back coldly on her heart at
these equivocal words.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
Kate, however, did not notice this: hope blinded
her eyes, willingly; and she eagerly answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would bring us words of cheer. He
is free—he is on his way hither; he will be here
soon. Is it not so?” and she looked so beautifully
earnest, as she lifted her eyes eagerly to Major
Lindsay’s face, that he vowed inwardly no obstacle
should prevent him from winning so charming a
bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly that,” he replied, with some hesitation.
“Mr. Mowbray is not free yet—but I hope,
nay, I may promise that he is in no danger—that is,
provided,” he stopped, embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Blakeley looked searchingly at the speaker,
yet her heart would not allow her to entertain the
suspicion that had flashed across her, and she discarded
it indignantly. Kate, hurled suddenly from
her pinnacle of hope, trembled, and clung speechlessly
to her aunt’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lindsay’s embarrassment continued. He
looked imploringly at Mrs. Blakeley, as if he half
expected her to come to his aid. But Mrs. Blakeley
was as agitated as Kate. She struggled to subdue
her emotion, saying, eagerly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not torture us by suspense, I implore you,
Major Lindsay. If any thing is expected of us, fear
not to tell us at once; we will strip ourselves to the
uttermost farthing, if a heavy fine can save my
brother’s life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lindsay, thus thrown on his own resources,
hesitated and stammered, but found words at length
to say,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be alarmed, ladies. I repeat it, there is
nothing to fear. But I come rather as an ambassador
than as the herald of joy. In other words, I have
certain matters to mention, which are preliminary,
I regret, to the pardon of Mr. Mowbray. My message,
too, is exclusively to Miss Mowbray, and I
fear can be delivered to her alone. But understand
me, there is no doubt of all yet going well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will leave you with this dear girl at once,” said
Mrs. Blakeley, imprinting a kiss on Kate’s brow.
“I need scarcely say how deeply she has been
agitated, and beg you to spare her as much as
possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do it,” said Major Lindsay earnestly, his
eyes compassionately bent on Kate; and Mrs.
Blakeley, notwithstanding her suspicions, could not
doubt his sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate trembled with a strange <a id='fore'></a>foreboding feeling, as
she saw the door close on her aunt; and yet what
was there of alarm in this approaching interview?
Were not the words and looks of Major Lindsay
kind and encouraging? Yet still Kate trembled to
find herself alone with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apartment in which Major Lindsay found
himself, was one with which he had been familiar
on his preceding visit to the mansion; but, for a
minute after Mrs. Blakeley’s exit, he gazed around
him as if examining for the first time the architecture
and furniture of the room. It was an apartment,
too, well worth his scrutiny. Few even of
the gentry of that proud state could boast a dwelling
like that of Mrs. Blakeley. The walls of the parlor
were wainscoted to the ceiling with richly carved
cornices; and over the mantelpiece, encircled by a
wreath of roses carved in the wood, were the arms
of the family. The furniture was of mahogany, consisting
of massive tables and chairs, with elaborately
carved feet. A couple of fine portraits adorned the
walls—one a picture of the deceased Mr. Blakeley,
the other a likeness of Mr. Mowbray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lindsay cast his eyes from the cornice to
the floor, and from the mantelpiece to the portraits,
and at length stealthily turned them in the direction
of Kate, who sat on the sofa, her color rapidly
changing, equally constrained and embarrassed.
That a young and almost inexperienced girl should
want perfect self-possession was less singular, however,
than that a practiced man of the world like
Major Lindsay should be without it. But the truth
was that he scarcely knew how to introduce his
errand to Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his eyes, however, met those of the fair girl,
there was an expression of surprise and inquiry at
his silence, not to be misunderstood; and he thought
it best to refer at once to the purpose of the interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It pains me exceedingly—you cannot imagine
how much—my dear Miss Mowbray,” he began,
“to come here without the unconditional pardon of
your father. But there are two circumstances which
prevented me from succeeding to the extent of my
wishes, and thus having the honor and pleasure of
bringing you such welcome news. In the first place,
Mr. Mowbray is not, as you suppose, a prisoner to
Col. Watson, that officer being on his march to join
Lord Rawdon at Camden; but, on the contrary, is
in the hands of Lieut. Col. Campbell, who now holds
the post of Georgetown, and who, besides being a
gentleman of a more inexorable nature, is personally
unacquainted with your father. Now, had it been
Col. Watson to whom Mr. Mowbray had been surrendered,
I indulge the hope that, difficult as the
task would have been, his intimacy with yourself
and Mrs. Blakeley, to say nothing of my own solicitations,
would have procured the release of your
parent. But with Col. Campbell the case is different.
He is not only a stranger to you all, but he
is nearly an entire stranger to myself. There does
not exist between us those terms of intimacy that,
in the case of Col. Watson, would have justified
me in asking for the release of your father as a
personal favor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Major Lindsay stopped, as if expecting
Kate to answer; but she only bowed. It was evident
also from her look of continued surprise that
she could not yet make out the speaker’s purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
“In the second place,” continued Major Lindsay
slowly, “there is nothing in this case to distinguish
it from others—nothing, I mean, to justify Colonel
Campbell in his own eyes for pardoning your parent,
when so many others, also taken with arms in their
hands, are executed. Lord Rawdon’s orders are
explicit. Every man who, having once signed the
protection, is afterward captured fighting against
the king, is to be punished with death. This command
hitherto has been rigidly enforced. Nor is
there in Mr. Mowbray’s case, as I before said, any
thing to take him out of the general rule. On the
contrary, as Col. Campbell assured me, there is
every reason why he should be proceeded against
even more rigidly than others. Your father is rich
and has great personal influence; and his pardon
would lead the gentry generally to suppose that
they could revolt with impunity. To suffer the
leaders to escape—these were the words of my
superior—yet punish their deluded followers, is neither
justice nor good policy. These considerations
induced Col. Campbell, to whom I hastened at once
as an intercessor, being fortunately in Georgetown,
to refuse my suit, though he kindly condescended
to explain the reasons, as I have recapitulated to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate clasped her hands at these words, and became
pale as a corpse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he is to die!” she gasped. “It is thus you
would break the news to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, not so, as I hope in heaven!” cried Major
Lindsay, earnestly, springing forward to support the
fainting girl. “Your father’s life may yet be spared—Col.
Campbell himself assured me how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate’s eyes were eagerly turned to the speaker
at these words, though by a motion of her hand she
waved off his assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The colonel said,” continued Major Lindsay,
seeing she waited for him to speak, “that it was
only necessary to give a proper pledge to the royal
government for his future neutrality, and Mr. Mowbray
might yet be saved. He himself hinted at the
character of that pledge, or else I should have remained
in doubt. ‘Go to Miss Mowbray,’ he said,
‘and tell her that with her it rests to preserve her
father’s life. I have heard of your suit in that quarter;
obtain her consent to a speedy marriage; and
then to the father-in-law of one of his majesty’s most
faithful subjects I can grant that life which I must
deny to a rebel in arms.’ These were his words.
And now, dear Miss Mowbray, think not I come to
take advantage of you,” said Major Lindsay,
speaking rapidly and eagerly, as he saw her avert
her face, “God knows nothing is further from my
thoughts. But it is the weakness of love to be
selfish, and when the way by which I might win
my suit was thus pointed out to me, I had not the
strength to resist. Besides, I knew I should never
forgive myself if I refused to come, and your father
lost his life in consequence. My very love for you,
by making me anxious for his life, would have
forced me hither, even if I knew beforehand that
you would spurn me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprise and indignation chased each other
through Kate’s mind at hearing these words. The
embarrassment of Major Lindsay was now explained,
for well might he hesitate to avow his baseness
in making her father’s life the price of her
hand. Kate was firmly persuaded that he might
have saved her parent if he would; and her bosom
heaved with indignant feelings. But had she known
all: had she known that Major Lindsay himself had
planned her father’s capture, and instigated his
superior to dictate the only terms of pardon—how
would she have turned from him with horror and
loathing inexpressible!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate’s first impulse was to rise and leave the
room. But she remembered how completely she
was in her auditor’s power, and her feelings suffered
a revulsion. She burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see I pain you,” said the major, in affected
sorrow. “Nay! then I will leave your presence.
Heaven bless you!” and he rose sadly and prepared
to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate was staggered by these words. Could one
who thus spoke have really acted as basely as she
but now supposed? She could not believe it. Yet
she still turned with repugnance from the idea of a
union with Major Lindsay. Meantime that individual
had advanced several steps toward the door,
while Kate continued sobbing violently on the sofa.
Her heart was torn with conflicting emotions. If
she suffered her visiter to depart, her father’s blood
would be on her hands. The major had already
turned the lock: there was no longer room for delay.
Springing wildly from her seat, she rushed
forward and laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay!” she gasped. “Do with me as you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gleam of triumph shot across Major Lindsay’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know not how you transport me,” he said
rapidly. “If the devotion of a life can repay you
for this promise, here I swear to bestow it in requital,”
and taking those fair but listless fingers in
his hand, he would have raised them to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Kate instinctively drew them back, and with
an almost haughty gesture. The next moment,
however, she again burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she exclaimed, “is there no other way?
Be generous, Major Lindsay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood like an imploring Niobe, her eyes raised
in supplication, her whole face beaming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The countenance of her auditor, on that sudden
withdrawal of her hand, had flushed with sudden
anger; but he had now once more controlled his
features to a look of pity, and he replied⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would I could do as you wish; would there was
some other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is—there is,” said Kate, eagerly. “You
yourself will go again to Col. Campbell and intercede
for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! I have done that already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
“To Lord Rawdon, then,” breathlessly interposed
Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be useless. Nay, if he hears of this
matter prematurely, before you are mine, neither
Col. Campbell nor I can save your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tone of decision in him as he pronounced
these words, that shut out all farther entreaty.
Kate felt, moreover, that what he said was
true; from Lord Rawdon no hope could be entertained.
With a groan she buried her face against
the sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lindsay stood at a respectful distance.
During the interview he had more than once been
smote to the heart by Kate’s agony. He was not a
villain in the ordinary acceptation of the term. Impelled
by his necessities, and stung by Kate’s persevering
refusal, he had planned her father’s capture,
intending to purchase her hand by his pardon, and
little doubting that, in time, she would learn to love
him. He had found little difficulty in persuading
Col. Campbell to further his scheme, representing to
that officer that Kate was not indifferent to him in
secret, but was unwilling, on her father’s account,
to marry a royal officer. But Major Lindsay, though
engaged in this black plot, really loved Kate; and
had he not gone too far to retreat, perhaps would
have been moved from his purpose by the sight of
her suffering. His <a id='comm'></a>commiseration was not, therefore,
all affected; and even now, as he stood awaiting
her final decision, which he no longer doubted
would be in his favor, a pang of remorse shot through
his heart on raising his eyes and beholding Mr.
Mowbray’s picture—for the mute canvas seemed to
rebuke him with its sad, earnest gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps five minutes thus passed—the major
leaned on his sword—Kate, her face buried from
sight, continued to sob. At length she looked up,
and holding out her hand with averted head, she
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father shall be saved.” And then, as if
almost choked by the words, she added, “Leave
me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for those blessed words,” said
Major Lindsay; and bowing over her hand, which
he just touched with his lips, he left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate waited till the door closed after him, then,
with a cry of anguish, she gave way to fresh tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, miserable, unhappy me!” she groaned,
“would nothing but this save my father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once she started up, and a wild gleam of
joy irradiated her face. She dashed the tears from
her eyes; for the first time it had occurred to her that
Preston could avert her horrible destiny—in what
way she knew not; but in childhood he had always
been her protection, and she still felt the habit of
looking up to him in peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in an instant came the reflection of the terms
on which they now stood to each other. They had
parted in anger; and he either despised or hated
her. Under such circumstances her womanly modesty
revolted from appealing to him for aid. “No,”
she mentally ejaculated, “I will die sooner.” And
as she came to this resolution, she fell back again
in hopeless misery on her seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lindsay, meanwhile, had sought out Mrs.
Blakeley, to whom he related the result of his interview
with Kate. To her aunt, who knew little of
our heroine’s feelings, the sacrifice appeared an inconsiderable
one; and Mrs. Blakeley had always
regarded Major Lindsay with favor. She informed
her guest that they were soon to set forth for Georgetown,
and invited him to accompany them. He
declined, alledging the necessity of his returning as
speedily as possible; but offered to leave a portion
of his dragoons to escort the ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be the first to meet you in Georgetown,”
he said, as he bid Mrs. Blakeley farewell on the
steps of her mansion; and plunging spurs into his
steed, he was soon out of sight with his train.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>“Who thundering comes on blackest steed.”—<span class='sc'>Byron.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>While Major Lindsay was galloping from Blakeley
Hall, Captain Preston, by the same road, was advancing
toward it. He had been out on a scouting
expedition, and hearing that Kate was still with her
aunt, determined, in a moment of relenting, to visit
her. He had not yet heard of her father’s capture—of
course he was ignorant of her own peril; and
Kate determined that he should still remain so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rapidity of Major Lindsay’s pace was in
unison with the tumult of his thoughts. Now that
all was settled, conscience was stilled; and he felt
only the wild exultation of success. Exposure was
the only thing he had to dread; but of that he felt
no alarm, the unsettled state of the country affording
secrecy as well as impunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no doubt Kate would soon love him.
With other women he had generally been successful;
he attributed his failure in her case to her
remembrance of Preston as her old playmate. But
once finding herself the husband of another, duty
would soon teach her to forget the past. Occupied
with these reflections, Major Lindsay’s spirits rose.
Triumphant guilt is rarely given to remorse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But one thing only is wanting,” he said. “If I
could meet this Preston—this braggadocia—I would
at once have my revenge, and get rid of all possibility
of future rivalry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if in answer to this half expressed wish, there
was at that moment seen, on the crest of a slight
elevation in front, a single horseman, who, even at
that distance, was recognized as wearing the uniform
of Marion’s brigade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wheel to the right,” said Major Lindsay sharply
and suddenly to his dragoons, “into this old wood-road.
Halt! We will lie in ambush here until we
know something of the strength of the enemy. They
do not yet see us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His orders were immediately executed. The
troopers dashed into the pine barren, where they
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
were easily concealed behind some high brush.
Major Lindsay alighted and stealthily advanced to
reconnoitre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First he saw a trooper idly descending the hill;
then another immediately cut the clear acclivity
with his figure; and soon a third, fourth, and fifth
appeared in rapid succession. The last comer was
at a gallop, and dashed by the others until he reached
their head. Even at that distance Major Lindsay
thought there was something familiar in this person.
He could not believe, however, that he had seen
the whole of the enemy’s force, until the five horsemen
had nearly descended the hill, when he concluded
that they were merely a scouting party of
the foe. He beckoned to him his orderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know those fellows?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The approaching horsemen were still at a considerable
distance, so the man, shading his eyes
with one hand, while with the other he held back
the brushwood to get an opening for his face, peered
long and eagerly. Then he drew back, nodding his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know ’em,” he said, “least ways one o’ ’em,
who is that Capt. Preston that used to plague us so,
up at the hall, yonder,” and he jerked his finger over
his shoulder in the direction of Mrs. Blakeley’s,
which they had left about an hour before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure?” said Major Lindsay, eagerly.
“I would rather lose a dozen guineas than that you
should be mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll keep your guineas, sir,” said the
orderly, “that’s Capt. Preston, and nobody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that fellow, Macdonald, with him? He is
worth two men, and it would be a lucky hit to get
both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, I know his cut well—but he’s not along.
And that’s odd too, for he and Capt. Preston always
go together like dogs hunting in couples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we have him!” said Major Lindsay, exultingly.
“He cannot escape us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we blow trumpet and charge at once
then?” said the orderly. “Our men will go at ’em
like hungry wolves. They’ve a long score to settle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet,” said Major Lindsay, “we will wait
till those fellows come up; then, boot and saddle,
and upon them. I would not have them escape us
for my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dragoons, informed who the enemy was,
chafed impatiently to begin the attack—for they had
a hundred insults to avenge on the bold partisan before
them. Meanwhile, our hero, for the orderly
had been right in saying Capt. Preston led the troop,
approached on a trot, completely unconscious of the
presence of his hidden enemy. He was engaged
in a scouting expedition of some extent, and had
no idea an armed royalist was within twenty miles.
Suddenly, however, he drew in his rein, for he
thought he heard a horse stamping in the forest;
but it was too late; Major Lindsay saw they were
discovered, and immediately gave the long wished
for word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charge!” he said, plunging his rowels into the
sides of his horse, and clearing at one bound the
space between him and the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a loud huzza, the dragoons shouting, “no
quarter,” followed his example, horse and man suddenly
filling the road like apparitions. Preston saw
he was surrounded. Their cries told him, moreover,
that it was to be a life and death struggle.
Five against fifteen was fearful odds, yet he cried,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marion for ever!” and drawing his sabre, he
dashed at Lindsay, whom he recognized. “Ha!
have we met!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! and I have you,” was the reply hissed between
his adversary’s teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Major Lindsay thus spoke, he raised himself
in his stirrups, and throwing all his strength into one
gigantic blow, he brought his heavy sabre down,
right on the almost unprotected head of Preston.
For a moment it seemed as if the trenchant blade
would cut through cap and skull, even to the
shoulder—and had it struck fair it would; but with
a dexterous movement, our hero evaded the stroke,
and in return dealt a side cut that, if Major Lindsay’s
horse had not fortunately swerved, would have
ended his life at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though foiled in this first attempt, each was
eager to return to the charge, and wheeling their
horses, they rushed again upon each other. It was
Preston’s turn now to deal the first blow. He rode
with very short stirrups, of which he took advantage
to throw himself backward, and then, projecting
himself forward, and casting all his strength into
the blow, he brought his sabre down on the helmet
of Major Lindsay with a force that was <a id='irr'></a>irresistible.
Cutting clean though the crest as if it had been a
smoke wreath, the well-proved blade descended
with full violence on the steel cap, through which
it crashed like an egg-shell; but here it stopped,
broken into fragments by the tremendous stroke
and the resistance of the iron casque combined.
Nothing but that well-tempered steel head-piece
could have saved Major Lindsay’s life. As it was,
stunned and bewildered, he reeled in his saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hew him down!—Use the cold lead!—Have at
him there, one and all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the exclamations that met our hero’s
ear, as he recovered himself from that blow, and
found only the hilt and a fragment of his broken
blade left in his hand. He looked around hastily.
His four followers had already been put <span class='it'>hors <a id='hors'></a>de
combat</span>, and the dragoons were now, like dogs around
a wild boar, waiting a chance to rush in on him,
encouraging each other by shouts; for such was
the terror of Preston’s name, and so terrific was the
blow they had just seen dealt their leader, that each
man hung back an instant, preferring that his
neighbor should go in first. Preston saw this advantage,
and hastened to avail himself of it, for, as
pistols were already drawn, he knew his chance
would last scarcely a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, Thunderer!” he said, addressing his steed—a
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
powerful animal, jet black all over—and turning his
head toward that part of the circle of his foes which
seemed the thinnest, he added, “stand by me now,
and we escape them yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, he dashed his spurs into the animal’s
sides till the blood spurted beneath the sharp steel,
and with a pistol in his right hand, sprang fiercely
forward. Right and left the dragoons, panic-struck,
gave way, as when a flock of sheep fly before the
onset of an angry wolf—only one man attempting
to stop his progress. But, without so much as being
wounded, the trooper went down headlong, overthrown
by the shock of Preston’s powerful charger;
and our hero, yielding to an uncontrollable impulse,
as he saw the way thus cleared before him, rose in
his stirrups, and waving his arm on high, looked
back, and gave utterance to a shout that long after
he had vanished, like a bolt shot from some huge
catapult, echoed and re-echoed in the startled
woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is off, by God,” said the orderly. “Saw you
ever the like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a second the dragoons stood stupidly looking
at each other; then, all at once, a dozen pistols were
snapped at the fugitive, and a dozen steeds put to
the pursuit. Moreover, Major Lindsay, though his
head still swam from that tremendous blow, had recovered
sufficiently to understand what was passing,
and he now lent his voice to encourage the chase,
and himself pressed forward among the first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this had occupied less time than it has taken
us to relate it. The attack, the fight, the escape succeeded
each other like flashes of summer lightning;
and when Preston, adroitly turning his horse into
the narrow and winding road where his foes had
lain in ambush, passed momently out of sight, unharmed
by the shots that whistled past, it seemed to
him almost as if he were in a dream. But the shouts
of pursuers, and the rapid tread of hoofs, speedily
convinced him of the reality, and plying voice and
spur, he went onward at a slashing pace, now and
then looking behind to see if the dragoons gained
on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is something inexpressibly still and refreshing
in an old, deserted road, winding through a cool
pine-forest. The tall trees lapping overhead, the
thick carpet of splintering leaves below, and the
delicious fragrance all around, have always had a
charm for us; and Preston felt it so, especially after
the fierce excitement of that life and death struggle;
so that when he came to a little dark stream, gliding
softly across the road, he longed to stop and bathe
his throbbing temples, and take one long, sweet
draught, as he had often done upon a hot day in the
forest when a boy. But the red foe was behind him,
and he shot on like an arrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he came to an old clearing, which had
been long abandoned. Here, for about a quarter of
a mile, was an open space, where ploughed fields
had once been, but the furrows of which now were
overgrown with a dry, stunted grass. He would
have preferred the winding forest road, but there
was no alternative, and on he dashed. He had
nearly regained the shelter of the forest on the other
side, when he heard a wild burst of cheering, and
looking back, he saw the dragoons, with Major
Lindsay and one other in advance, entering on the
open space. They had caught sight of him for the
first time since he entered the old road, and their
shouts betokened renewed hope and determination
on their part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breathlessly Preston kept on, but with less assurance
than before, for his horse was already hard
worked, and he soon saw with dismay that blood
was flowing from his fore-shoulder freely from a
wound. A half mile further on the poor animal
began to flag sensibly; yet, cruel as it seemed, and
much as it pained his own generous nature, Preston
was forced to urge on the dying steed. He knew
that at the distance of a mile and a half ahead was
a swamp, into the recesses of which, if he could
once plunge, he would be safe. But now he heard
behind him a rapid hoof. It came nearer and
nearer, though still out of sight. One, if not more,
of his pursuers was gaining upon him. Again he
spurred his steed, and encouraged him with words.
The noble animal answered with a feeble cry, and
staggered on. Scarcely half a mile now remained to
gain the swamp. If he could only reach it, Preston
knew all danger would be past. But this was impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That rapid gallop came nearer and nearer, like
the clock that ticks the hour of the criminal’s fate.
He heard a shout behind him, and looking over his
shoulder saw the trooper, whom he had last noticed
side by side with Major Lindsay, come thundering
on. He cheered his dying steed to a last effort—but
it was in vain; the dragoon made two strides to his
one. A few paces only now separated them; the
swamp lay thrice the distance before. Already the
trooper had risen in his stirrups, broadsword in hand.
Preston had no such weapon. Suddenly he recollected
the pistol in his other holster, and drawing it
with the velocity of thought, he turned half around
in his saddle and fired. With unerring aim the ball
entered the brain of the dragoon, who fell dead to
the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the work of a moment to leap to the ground
and catch the fallen soldier’s horse, on which Preston
sprang. Poor Thunderer was already dead; he
had sunk to the earth as his master fired the last shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus fate interposed to prevent an interview between
Preston and our heroine, at a time when it
would have been of incalculable advantage to both,
and have circumvented a plot as base and cruel as
it was now certain of success. At the very hour
when Preston, after having ridden over thirty miles
from the spot where he was attacked, threw himself
wearied from his horse, in one of the most secret recesses
of the forest, Kate and her aunt were setting
forth for Georgetown, where they arrived on the
succeeding day.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
Never was human creature in a more isolated
and mournful situation than Kate now found herself.
Indulging in what she thought a hopeless passion,
every motive of delicacy forbade her revealing it to
those who alone could befriend her. She well knew
that if her father became aware how much her marriage
with Major Lindsay was against her inclinations,
he would interpose even at the very altar, and
ascend the scaffold to save her. Neither would it
do to let her aunt guess her abhorrence at this
union. Both her father and Mrs. Blakeley had,
indeed, at one time hoped that a matrimonial connection
would be formed between her and Preston,
but the mutual coldness of the parties had long since
dissipated this expectation. It was no time now to
reveal her secret preference; such a confession
would only have sealed her father’s fate without
rendering her happy. Kate was forced therefore to
wear a smiling face, when her heart was lacerated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Major Lindsay was compelled to be at Camden
in six days, his leave of absence closing at that
period, the marriage was fixed for the evening
before his departure. This was an earlier day
than Kate had looked for, but she could not object
without exposing her secret. She submitted therefore
in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who can tell the agony of her spirit, when in
company with her aunt and parent she was forced
to wear a smiling aspect! yet when alone she gave
free vent to her sorrow. The image of Preston
often intruded on those bitter moments. Alas! that
one so young should be so miserable. She could
have prayed for death but that it would have been
impious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, the heart, the heart! what a mystery it is.
There are blows worse than those on the wheel; it
is when a gay heart is broken with anguish.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span><h1><a id='exe'></a>THE EXECUTIONER.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY A NEW CONTRIBUTOR.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who, day by day, glance carelessly over a
newspaper, as they puff a cigar, or give relish to a
lazy breakfast, by running the eye over the brief
sketches of crime which appear in the morning
journals, with so much regularity, and in such equal
proportions, that we are almost led to conjecture
that each day receives by lot its due share of such
matter, seldom, if ever, think of the actual romance
of the events which come to them in such a barren
shape. How many broken hearts and peculiar
agonies are involved in the intimate details of that
arrest, the narrative of which appears among twenty
others, and is so told, that, perhaps, the only impression
which it makes upon the mind is one of
wonder at the feats of the police. What a fearful
stage in the history of some human spirit is following
the publication of that hasty but remorseless
paragraph, which may scarcely arrest the attention
as we trace the columns down for more stimulating
news, and yet, first, perhaps, publicly connects an
honorable name with low vice, and removes the
last motive to reform with the last hope of concealment.
It is well for those of gentle sensibilities that
fancy is not more discursive at such moments, and
that, by a kind law of our natures, the door of sympathy
seldom opens but to intrusive griefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite, however, of the callousness which the
monotony of crime induces, and which ranges, increasingly,
down from those who read of it with indifference
to those who commit with composure, it
is sometimes brought so near to us in all its bleak
reality of depravity and affliction, that we cannot
well avoid communion with its voices. There are
those who consider emotional culture a duty of self-education,
and who would have us, upon systematic
principle, subject ourselves to frequent contact with
guilt and its results. This doctrine may be carried
to excess; and yet but few can say that experience
has not proved that the impressions of an occasional
intimacy with life’s deep tragedies around us are
salutary and instructive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had stopped for the night, on a journey westward,
at the little town of ——. I was to leave it
again in half an hour, and in this short interval that
remained before the coach would arrive which was
to carry me on my way, I was comfortably seated
by a table in my own private apartment, alternately
sipping from a cup of coffee and searching for some
item of interest in the columns of a dull weekly,
still damp from the village press. My eye passed
hastily over the stereotype remarks of the country
editor, the absurd extravagance of its political articles,
and the unmeaning gossip of the neighborhood,
and rested, at last, with somewhat more interest,
upon a paragraph which, under conspicuous capitals
and innumerable marks of exclamation, had
been thrust into the paper at the last moment. It
contained the announcement of a robbery of the
United States mail, from the confusion and empty
verbiage of which I extracted these brief facts. The
mail had been attacked, just before dawn, by two
ill-looking men, who deliberately dragged the driver
from his seat, tied him to a tree, and then, without
further violence to his person, proceeded to rifle the
bags. This done, they had fled, leaving the open
letters scattered in the road, and the driver still
bound. There was nothing, to be sure, very extraordinary
in all this, except that it had occurred but
a few hours before, and within two or three miles
of where I sat. But when, soon after, the servant
came in, and, eager to convey such unusual news,
informed me that the men had been hotly pursued
and taken, and were then in close custody in one
of the rooms of that very house, on their way to the
county prison, my curiosity, I confess, was fairly
roused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Intensity of character is always interesting, whatever
may be its tendency. Profound intellectuality
and abandoned <a id='vill'></a>villainy are, perhaps, equally attractive,
when viewed in the light of mere food for
speculation. Our deepest feelings discover themselves
in our intercourse with the eccentric traits
of those of our own species. It is seldom the fear
of the elements, or of wild beasts, with which we
<a id='fri'></a>frighten children and distress ourselves. It is the
terror of strong men, of mad men, or of dead men,
that is, at all times, most natural and most urgent.
There is subject for deep reason and earnest philosophy
in these leadings of a wayward nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some, it is true, are so conversant with such
scenes that they lose the fresh effect which this
occurrence had upon me. It was a new thing to
have crime at my very door. It was no ordinary
event for me to mingle my breath with that of outlaw
men; of my own shape, indeed, but of wild
passions and strange excitements, who gambled
with such desperate stakes. I dropped the paper,
pushed myself back from the table, and bade the
servant go for the landlord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He soon appeared, and I requested that he would
get me a sight of the prisoners. My curiosity was
certainly not unusual, or unnatural, and I flattered
myself that my appearance gave weight to the wish.
He disappeared, but soon returned with a favorable
answer. With some caution, adopted to satisfy
my host, lest I should be observed by those who
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
might wish to indulge a similar desire, and might
lead him to regret his effort in my behalf, I approached
the room in which they were confined,
and at a signal agreed upon was admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a small apartment. The men were standing
at separate windows, looking out upon that open
world from whose highways and endless fields they
had been taken so suddenly. They were heavily
manacled at wrist and ankle. Deep suffering is not
sensitive, or easily startled, or perhaps their apathy
in this instance arose from sullenness, but neither
of them turned or moved as I entered. I nodded
to an officer watching at the door, thanked him in
low words for his courtesy in indulging my curiosity,
and then leaned back against the wall by his side,
and silently scrutinized the prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood, as I have mentioned, unmoved as
statues. Though their faces were concealed from
my view as they looked out, and their backs only
were presented, I could see that in age and general
appearance they were very different. They were
both dressed with tolerable decency, except that
their clothes were soiled and torn in the hurry of
their flight, and the struggle of their capture. One
of them was evidently very young, probably not
more than twenty, and the long, neglected hair
which fell upon his coat was light and soft. His
feet were small, his hands white and delicate, his
person slender and somewhat emaciated. They
showed gentle training.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companion was older, and his figure shorter
and more sturdy. He had an awkward stoop, and
his whole appearance was slouching and ungainly.
A profusion of coarse black hair fell straight over
his shoulders, without curl or gloss, and a thick
beard seemed to cover his face. He bore marks of
great strength in his short, thick neck and heavy
limbs. This was all that I could see, and I waited
patiently for a change in their positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re both of ’em,” whispered the officer,
“strangers in the neighborhood. I guess it’s a new
trade with ’em, for they’re not very keen. They
got nothing for their risk and then didn’t know how
to take themselves off. They’re bad looking chaps
though, and I wouldn’t wonder if they’d seen the
inside of a jail before to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of them is very young,” said I, “and looks
like a gentleman’s son. Do you see his hands and
feet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t think that of him,” said he, “if
you were to see his face once. It’s the worst face
that I ever saw in a young man. They’re both
game, too, and fought like the devil before we got
the irons on ’em. That black, Spanish-looking
rascal is as strong as a wild beast. He came mighty
near getting off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you catch them?” said I, “you seem
to have been prompt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We found ’em by accident, in the end,” said the
officer. “And it was their own foolishness, too,
that brought it about. We had given ’em up, and
were coming home, when we came across this
letter. The fellows had dropped it two or three
hundred yards from the house where we nabbed ’m.
They thought they were safe, and were just trying
to get something to eat. We wouldn’t have touched
’em, it’s likely, seeing ’em in a decent house, but
they started, like fools, and looked scared, and all
that, and we knew what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took the letter from him as he spoke. The seal
had been broken when it was found. The address
immediately arrested my attention. It was really a
very singular coincidence, and I could hardly believe
my eyes when I opened it. The letter was from
my most intimate college friend to his father. I had
not seen him for full two years, but in that interval
I had corresponded with him freely, and I knew his
present situation and something of his family history.
His father resided in the far west. The son was at
the east. He had remained at college when we
parted, where he was still preparing himself for the
bar, and the post-mark showed that it had been
written at that place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first impulse, on seeing the signature, was one
of honorable delicacy, and I had half folded the
letter to return it to the officer, when it occurred to
me that it had, no doubt, been already read and re-read;
that it would necessarily form part of the
chain of the testimony against the accused; that it
would be exposed to inspection by bench, bar, and
jury, and might at length find its way even to the
public papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts decided me, and I opened it and
read it. It surprised me somewhat; and though it
may be made a question whether I was right or
wrong in my mode of settling the point of delicacy,
there is nothing which should prevent me now from
placing it before the reader as accurately as my
memory will allow after so long a lapse of time.
It will not interest him as it did me, but its contents
bear upon other parts of my story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear Father</span>,—I received your letter of
the — instant in regular course of mail. I was
sincerely glad to hear that you had so far recovered
from an indisposition which at first threatened to be
serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry that my reply will convey news which
must distress you. George has returned from sea.
I met him in the street a few days ago with an ill-looking
companion. He came upon me suddenly.
I am never very self-possessed, and I was extremely
doubtful how to treat him. He saw me, however—knew
me at once—seized me by the hand and drew
me into a public room which opened upon the place
where we stood. I could not break away from him
without attracting attention. He affected a pleasure
which I suppose was assumed, in order to overcome
a repulsiveness of manner that he could not fail to
notice, and which I could not help. He asked about
you and Mary, and told me he was utterly destitute,
and needed money for his necessary wants. I gave
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
him a small sum to keep him from starving, and tried
to shake him off. This, however, I could not easily
do. He went on to say that he had determined to
see you again, and throw himself on your charity,
and was then actually on his way to the west. I
told him that your feelings had not changed, and
that his appearance would only make trouble and
give you pain. His resolution, notwithstanding
what I said, seemed unaltered, and I am afraid his
presence will soon annoy you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His appearance shocked me excessively. He
looks bloated and depraved beyond description, and
I fear from the expression of his face, and the
air of his companion, that he has gone far in vice
since he left you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish Mary could have seen him as I saw him.
She has been so unreasonable already, however, that
it might be well to send her from home in anticipation
of the threatened visit. Unless she is kept in ignorance
of it in this, or some other way, she may yet
give us much trouble and anxiety.
“Give my love to her, and believe me</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Your affectionate son,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Henry Eagleton, Jr.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that I was somewhat surprised. My
friend had occasionally mentioned the name of
George Ellis, his father’s ward, and had more than
once spoken of his own sister Mary. But though
I had deemed our intimacy sufficient for almost any
confidence, he had never touched upon circumstances
bearing in the remotest degree upon those
which had thus <a id='acc'></a>accidentally met my eye. Indeed I
recollected, or thought I recollected, that there had
always been a certain reserve in his conversation
about Ellis, which had at times excited a casual
curiosity. Now the mystery was in a measure explained.
From the letter in my hand I could gather
at a glance the main features of this family trouble.
I afterwards learned that its most important events
had happened after I parted with my friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What names have they given?” said I to the
officer, handing back the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None at all,” he replied. “The short one can’t
or won’t talk English, and the other is stubborn and
says nothing. They’ve jabbered together a little
in some foreign gibberish, but we can’t get any
thing out of ’em, do our best. If they knew what
they were about they’d just give in their names at
once as John Smith, or John Jones, and have done
with it. That’s the way the knowing ones do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this instant some one tapped at the door,
opened it slightly, and informed me that the coach
was waiting for me. Attracted by the sound the
younger of the prisoners turned fully round. I had
been looking for such a movement, and whispering to
the servant that I would be there presently, and
that in the meantime he could take down my trunk,
I stood for a moment longer by the side of the
officer, and with as little that was offensive in my
glance as possible, returned steadily the gaze of the
culprit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer was right. In so young a man I had
never seen so bad a face. Marks of brutal passion
and dissipation mingled with an expression of sullen
fear upon a countenance which might once have
been handsome, but was now far otherwise. His
eyes were heavy and bloodshot, and his skin red
and bloated. But he could not bear my scrutiny,
and cut it short by turning again to the window.
I had already delayed longer than I should have
done, and bidding the officer a hasty good-bye, I
left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In ten minutes more I was driving rapidly away.
On my return, I again passed through the town,
and found upon inquiry the result of the arrest.
The elder of the prisoners had been convicted upon
the testimony of the younger; the former was in
prison, the latter at large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the pressure of business, however, and of life’s
pursuits, the connected impressions of that scene
soon went from me. Matters of deeper interest
occupied my mind and enlisted my attention. My
correspondence with Eagleton, in which of course
I never hinted at my singular adventure, became
less and less frequent, and at last ceased entirely;
and before the time over which I now pass so hastily
had gone by, I had well nigh forgotten my early
friendship.</p>

<hr class='tbk113'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was some five years after the occurrence of
the scene which I have described, that on a visit to
the city in whose college I had received a part of
my education, I had occasion to employ counsel to
advise me in the conduct of perplexed and unpleasant
business. Seven years’ absence from the place
had nearly obliterated my slight knowledge of its
society, and I was obliged to make some inquiry in
reference to the character and comparative ability
of different members of the bar. Among other
names mentioned to me with commendation was
that of Henry Eagleton, my chum and classmate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sought no further, but determined without loss
of time to see him, revive our acquaintance, and
obtain his services. With the name, too, came back
my recollection of the scene at ——, and I felt a
deep desire to discover, if I could do so with delicacy,
the sequel to the brief narrative of that stolen
letter. I obtained his address, and soon stood at
the door of his office. I knocked, and in obedience
to a call from within, entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a large table on which lay open books and
scattered papers, in the confusion and disorder of
hasty use, sat my friend writing. He rose as I entered,
and though time had made some change in
my appearance and much more in his, we knew
each other at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was thinner and paler than when I had last
seen him, and all the buoyancy of his disposition had
gone. Then he was the soul of fun and innocent
mirth, now he was grave, reserved, and business-like,
and his features wore a deep tinge of melancholy.
He was chatty and companionable, however,
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
to me; and as passing from one lively topic to
another we talked of old times and college freaks,
his reserve wore away, and his face lighted up with
smiles which probably had not played upon it for
years before, and which made him look much more
like my old friend Harry Eagleton. Maturity and
old age are marvelously indulgent to the faults and
follies of their youth, and while we recalled one
scene after another of high frolic or absurd amusement,
we almost felt ready for their mischief again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we warmed in a conversation of such a character,
old sympathies revived, and our remarks became
closer and more personal. I freely went over
the general course of my life since we had parted,
and with apparently equal openness he spoke of his
own career. He had partly prepared himself for
the bar in the proper department of the institution
in which he had been graduated, had completed his
training in a private office in the same city, had determined
to settle there permanently in his profession,
had come to the bar under favorable auspices,
and with a delay much less than he had feared,
and was now in the full tide of successful practice,
reaping the fruits of an honorable and a lucrative
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked him, after some time, after his father and
sister. In a moment all sprightliness passed from
his countenance, and he answered me with the
deepest gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father had been dead for several years; his
sister was living with him, a confirmed and hopeless
invalid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not mention Ellis’s name, or push my inquiries
further, but after a short and awkward silence
touched abruptly on my own matters, and produced
the papers which bore upon the business that had
led me to his office. It was soon arranged. His
clear comprehension of facts which I deemed complicated,
and his better information as to their bearing
and effect soon simplified a case of much importance,
put it in a light more favorable to my own
interest than I had anticipated, and directed my
future course toward those concerned with me in
the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This over, our social chat re-commenced; and
though I feared to intrude upon his time, he pressed
me to remain seated, with an urgency which I could
not resist. We were soon wandering away again
with the memories which had already proved so
pleasant, and which seemed to freshen and increase
as we went on. After a prudent hesitation as to
the propriety of doing so, which perhaps yielded in
the end rather to inclination than to judgment, I
availed myself of some accidental turn in our conversation,
and related the adventure of my journey
to the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I began the story without hinting to him that his
name was involved. As I went on step by step,
his eye became fixed on mine with increasing interest.
I mentioned the letter and its address, and
was about to tell its contents, when Eagleton rose
suddenly, took me by the hand and led me into
an inner room. As I left the office I saw what I
had not noticed until then. In the shadow of a large,
high case, in a remote part of the apartment, with
his hands folded listlessly before him, and his head
drooping heavily over his lap, sat a young man apparently
about twenty-five years of age. In all our
lively and even noisy conversation, not a breath or
motion had apprised me of his presence. Without
seeming to observe him, however, I followed my
friend. I felt satisfied that I was now about to be
gratified by some disclosure connected with a history
in regard to which all my former curiosity had
returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He closed the door between the rooms, handed
me a chair, drew another opposite to it, and as we
sat down facing each other, he begged me to
resume my narrative. He eyed me steadily as I
proceeded, and at times expressions passed over
his features whose meaning, with all my skill, I
could not fathom—expressions of changing but controlled
emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told the story to its end. With an accuracy of
memory which surprised me, and seemed strangely
supplied for the call of the occasion, I repeated this
letter as I have given it already. When I mentioned
the arrival of the servant to hurry me away,
a shade of disappointment was evidently perceptible.
When I spoke of the sudden movement of the
younger of the prisoners, the hasty opportunity I
had obtained, by his change of position, of examining
his face, and then described his forbidding and depraved
appearance, all his eager interest returned,
and he bent forward as he sat, intent upon every
word that passed my lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I paused at length, for my narrative was at an
end; yet though I had ceased, so absorbed was he
in that rapid description, that he still leaned toward
me as though he hoped that I would give one touch
more to the picture. Then he fell back in his chair
absorbed in deep thought, which overlooks all apology
for its silence, and peremptorily forbids interruption—sat
thus for some minutes—rose and paced
the room with rapid and unequal strides, and stood
in the end abruptly before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you pass through —— on your return?” said
he with the tone and manner of one who rather
thought the question aloud than uttered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied that I had, and mentioned in a few words
what I had heard in reference to the prisoners, and
the result of the proceedings against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Eagleton paced the room. I watched him
with earnest curiosity, but did not by motion or remark
interfere with his mood. It was one which
must shortly explain itself. His step became gradually
calmer and more steady, and at length he
quietly sank into his chair. His countenance was
grave, but without any manifest traces of agitation
or excitement, and he looked steadily at me as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw, no doubt,” said he, “in the room we
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
just left, a young man seated by a case. I am about
to call him in for a moment. Will you be kind
enough to observe him narrowly, and tell me when
he is gone whether you have ever seen him before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose once more, and with an appearance of
composure, which was evidently assumed, opened
the door through which we had just passed, called
to the person who was sitting there, and then
quietly resumed his seat. I heard a slow, shuffling
step across the floor within, and presently the person
called, whoever he was, appeared. I looked at
him eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was an idiot. I could see that clearly and at
a glance. His vacant face gave undoubted evidence
of the visitation of that peculiar judgment under
whose influence the light within goes out; yet his
features were not bad, and if one particle of intelligence
had shown in his sunken eye, he might,
perhaps, have passed without notice or remark in
spite of his wan and unhealthy complexion, his unmeaning
expression, and his listless gait and carriage.
It was that dull, preternatural stare that
made him so melancholy a spectacle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recollected well the face of the younger prisoner.
It had made a fast and painful impression on my
mind. Many a time it had been present with me;
seldom as part of the scene in which it first appeared,
but coming suddenly and unattended, looking
at me as I mused. In my fancies my character
had assumed it wholly or in fragments. If I slept I
had fitted it to the creatures of my dream. A face
alone—nothing else; but a face clearly chiseled,
and with every point and line distinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the man before me and he were the same, a
fearful change had passed over him. But Eagleton
had evidently connected the idiot with my story, and
after the eagerness of his manner as I told the result
of that last accidental scrutiny of the features of the
man at ——, and his subsequent singular request, I
should have been dull indeed if I had not seen the
drift of his thoughts, though I was in utter ignorance
of the precise course they had pursued, and of the
remote reasons of his conduct. The robber had an
eye full of meaning and evil purpose—the face before
me wore no shade of depravity; and yet as I
looked resemblances occurred, became gradually
more striking and more convincing, fastened themselves
upon me with a tenacity that I could not
shake off, and at last blended the two faces into
one. I became satisfied of their identity as fully as
if the awkward figure before me, guarded and
manacled, were gazing yet from the window at
which years before it had met my eye. It was not
mere fancy, or an opinion forced upon me by the
circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet I feared that it was, and to dispel any
cloud that might rest upon my mental vision, or
any nervous delusion which interfered with the
correctness of the result at which I aimed, I rose
and looked out for a few moments upon some
climbing vines and clustered roses that grew by an
open door, and then resumed my seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend, rather to aid my observation than to
give a reason for his call, had been speaking slowly
to the object of my attention, until becoming satisfied
from my manner that I was prepared to answer
his question, he quietly dismissed him, and turned
toward me again with the same affected composure
in his movements, but with an eye full of eager
inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eagleton,” said I, “if I am right, a greater change
has passed over that face in five years than death
itself could have produced. But you have made a
request, and I comply with it. I believe, before God,
that the person I have just seen is the same to
whose description you have just been listening.
That description does not now apply, and yet it is
a true one. I have doubted my conclusion, and
distrusted memory, but I cannot relieve myself of
the conviction I have expressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was evidently prepared for the answer, and
did not seem shocked or surprised, though the shade
of gloom increased upon his countenance. He rose
again, and paced the floor so long that I became impatient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need not tell you,” said he, at last resuming his
seat once more, “that what you have seen, and what
you are about to hear, are in the deepest confidence.
I do not ask your pledge to keep it, but I leave it
to your honor till I am dead. You have not only become
acquainted, by accident, with family troubles
which I hoped until to-day would die with those
connected with them, but by that same accident
have been enabled to tell me that of which I did
not know before, but which, now that I have heard
it, solves many doubts, and explains facts before
inexplicable. I am composed, but the answer
to my question, for the candor of which I thank you,
has pained me excessively; and yet, when you have
listened to what I have to say, you will doubtless
wonder at my sensibility upon such a subject as
much as you now wonder at my indifference to your
announcement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young man you have just seen is George
Ellis. My sister is his wife. Until your visit to-day,
however much I may have suspected, no words
brought to my ear had ever certainly fastened crime
upon, or tainted his name with any thing but vice
and dissipation, in which I know he has been
deeply steeped. To-day you have added that stain
to his character. But why should I fret over what
cannot be recalled. I have one real consolation.
My sister has never known this new degradation,
and will die in ignorance of your disclosures. As
to Ellis, he is past feeling. You have seen his
situation. But I must proceed with my narrative.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not tell the tale in Eagleton’s words. In
spite of all his efforts to control his feelings, they
occasionally broke out in exclamations of deep
pathos and bitter invective, and led him wandering
off from the direct thread of his story. Besides, I
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
subsequently learned many facts which neither of us
knew at that time, but which were closely interwoven
with the scenes through which I am about to
carry the reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father of George Ellis and the father of my
friend were once partners in mercantile business,
in a thriving town of the West. The firm was
Ellis &amp; Eagleton. It did a large business, was
widely known and much respected. Mr. Ellis was
a man of information and integrity, but a free liver
and a man of the world. He never married. He
had, however, this son, whom he seemed to love
more warmly because there was a stigma upon his
birth, or, perhaps, because its history was connected
with associations that were painful. But whatever
was the reason for his father’s blind attachment,
George was humored and indulged, until, even
while a child, he became the pest and terror of the
neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that the offspring of illicit passion are
generally marked by insanity of character. Be that
as it may, it matters not here. There was enough
to account for the worst traits of his disposition, in
the unbridled license of his early training, and the
foolish devotion of a worldly father. If ever there
was an evil spirit in human shape, that spirit was
George Ellis. From the very cradle the fiend
showed itself. Boys of his own age fled from him
as if he had been a wild beast. Eagleton, though
older, was afraid of him. No one could govern
him, least of all his own parent; and his reputation
for mad freaks and reckless mischief soon spread
far and wide, and rapidly increased as he became
older. And yet with all this, with that dark, bad
eye and bold air, he was as handsome a fellow as
ever grew to be a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father died when he was about eighteen. He
died utterly bankrupt. With scrupulous honor,
however, even in the excesses which had led to
such a result, he had not involved his firm. On his
deathbed he sent for Mr. Eagleton, told him that he
died without a dollar to leave behind him, and with
an earnestness which, perhaps, at such a moment,
could not have been refused, committed his son to
his partner’s care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a terrible legacy from a ruined man. My
friend’s father might have known that Mr. Ellis’s
wish could not be complied with, and that it would
be absolutely impossible for him to assume such a
trust. It would have been happy for him if he
could have felt so. It would have saved him much
affliction, and have given to his life happy years
that sorrow soon cut off. But the destiny was
otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never saw Mary Eagleton. I know, however,
that, at the time of which I speak, she was the belle
of her village, the pet and pride of her father and
brother. At the date of my interview with Henry
in a distant city, she was a mere shadow of what
she had once been—a wreck in mind and body—oppressed
with pain and increasing infirmities.
These were all portions of that same fearful
legacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the death of Mr. Ellis she had often seen
his son. She was about his age, and had been
attracted by his appearance. This was all. He
was deemed a dangerous acquaintance, and a close
and watchful care prevented intimacy. Now, by
the last prayer of a dying parent, the profligate was
brought to her very door, and sat at her very table
and fireside. Her father might have prevented this,
and yet have fulfilled his duty to the dead. He
was blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They soon understood each other. But their conduct
was cautious and baffled a watchfulness that
was keenly awake. I need not clog my narrative
with details. Her brother was away; her father
could not be always near her. George was depraved
and heartless, she was young and foolish.
A private marriage terminated their intercourse, for
the heart broken father cast the bridegroom off, at
once, sternly, and forever. His wife never saw
him again until, years after, in a distant city, he was
brought to her bedside—an idiot. The bequest was
not yet exhausted. But it might have been worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellis soon after went to sea in a merchant vessel
bound for a foreign port. He was too abandoned
even for such a society. On the first arrival of the
ship at her destination he was set on shore. Without
money, or character, yet with enough shrewdness
to keep him from starving, he plunged desperately
into all the temptations of a depraved city.
Vice and poverty soon led to crime. It was not
many months before he concealed himself, a fugitive
from justice, on board of a vessel bound for his own
country, and with a companion in his guilt, a
Spaniard, arrived in the United States but a few
days before the meeting mentioned in my friend’s
letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hours after that meeting he and his companion
were on their way westward. Ellis hoped to be
received again. The Spaniard had nothing to lose,
and some adventure in a new country might turn
to his advantage. But hard want pressed them
sorely. Begging was a slow and servile support.
Labor was not so much as thought of. To such
minds an answer to the fearful questionings of hunger
was not doubtful, or long delayed. Their first
adventure was the crime at ——. As Ellis turned
over the letters which they had scattered in the
road his eye was attracted by the address of one of
them. He opened it, read it, and quietly put it in
his pocket. It proved, as we have seen, the means
of their arrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Spaniard’s name was Antonio. I never
heard any other. He was more mature than Ellis
in years and in depravity. But the most striking
trait of his character was one that will appear hereafter.
From the moment of their arrest the prisoners
preserved a dogged silence. Antonio could not
speak a word of English. Ellis had his own reason
for the course he pursued. The driver of the mail,
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
whose person they had treated so unceremoniously,
and who, upon their first capture, had been loud in
his confidence of their identity with those who had
bound him, a few days after declared that his first
impressions were hasty, and declined backing his
assertion by an oath. The mail which they had
robbed had afforded them nothing worth having,
and, at the time of their seizure, they had about
them no evidence of guilt. The only grounds of
suspicion against them were the fact that they were
strangers; the letter found near them; their seeming
alarm upon seeing the officers; their dogged and
persevering silence, and their reckless and abandoned
appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners were confined in separate cells.
The officers, who have always motives for industry
appealing to them in such cases, saw, at a glance,
which was the oldest and most hardened offender,
and from which of them they were most likely to
gain their object. Ellis was wary and knew their
game, but he was without honor, and intensely
selfish. His sullenness at last relaxed. He gave
them, cautiously, to understand that he would convict
Antonio to secure his own escape, and it was
determined to use him as a witness against his accomplice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I need not give the details of the trial. Ellis appeared
in the box and gave evidence, coolly, against
the accused. The Spaniard was too much a stranger
to the form of the proceeding to understand the
scheme at once. But light at last broke in upon him
and revealed the treachery. From that moment
one burning dream, overcoming all fear of punishment,
and strangely composing the bitterness of
solitude rested upon him. It was a delirious prayer
for revenge, in a heart as malignant as was ever
shut from human eye. The witness would have
trembled if he could have looked within it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence was effectual. Antonio was convicted,
and received the severest sentence that the
law allowed—ten years imprisonment. He was
taken to his cell. Ellis went at large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A copy of Eagleton’s letter to his father had been
re-mailed, several weeks after the arrest, by some
person to whose hand it had come, more considerate
than those who had first held it. At the foot a brief
explanation was given of the circumstances which
rendered it necessary to retain the original, and an
apology for the delay in communicating its contents.
When it reached its destination Mr. Eagleton
was laboring under a second and more serious
attack of the same illness which the letter mentioned.
It had been brought about by mental suffering,
and, so alarming were the symptoms, that
his daughter had just despatched a letter to hasten
her brother home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this juncture that the copy was received.
As she had frequently done before since her father’s
sickness, Mary opened the letter to read it aloud.
It surprised her. It began as only her brother’s
letters began, and yet the handwriting was not his.
As she read she grew pale, her lips trembled, and
at length bursting into tears, she left the room.
The invalid took it from the bed, on which she had
dropped it, sat up, and, much moved, read it through.
The news was such as he did not wish to believe.
The whole matter was singular, and with a flushed
face and increased fever he dropped again upon his
pillow. If it were really from his son, all reserve
or secrecy toward his daughter was at an end, and
all that could be done was to await her husband’s
arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excitement was injurious, Mr. Eagleton
became so much feebler from day to day that Mary’s
greatest fear now was that her brother might not
come until too late. It was as she had apprehended.
Death came rapidly on, and she was
alone at its crisis. In a few days she sat beside the
dead body of her father, and in a few more, the only
mourner, followed him to his grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet her brother did not come. Again and
again she wrote to him, with an urgency which
showed how lonely and unprotected she felt.
There was a trial which she anticipated, and
which she feared to meet without his aid. She
felt assured that her first letter had not reached him,
and the journey was one of many days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A traveler arrived at last, but it was not Henry.
In the hall of the mansion from which he had been
thrust out with bitter curses, tattered and wretched
and bleached with prison gloom, stood the outcast,
the fugitive, the robber, the dishonored witness—George
Ellis. His wife had pledged her word to
her dying father that she would not see him again,
and here he stood in her very house, her rightful
husband. Her heart throbbed fearfully between
returning love and religious duty. But she kept
her word to the dead, refused to see him, and
shutting herself in her own room, awaited the
coming of her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Eagleton had left a will, but it bore date before
the marriage, and did not provide for the state
of things which that event produced. Ellis was
aware that as her husband he had legal rights, and
that her father’s death had given them effect; but
he was ignorant of their actual nature, and caution
taught him to refrain from violence. He did not
intrude upon his wife’s privacy, but, with all the
coolness of <a id='vill2'></a>villainy, he made himself at home in the
house from which the dead had just been borne,
and trusted to her woman’s weakness, and a love,
the strength of which he knew too well, to cure her
of her solitary mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my friend appeared, and the face of affairs
soon changed. He met Ellis on his arrival, and,
surprised at his presence, soon gathered from the
servants a history of what had occurred. His first
impulse was to eject him forcibly, but better suggestions
made him change his purpose. Without
allowing them to inform his sister of his arrival, he
hastened to the office of his father’s attorney and
apprised himself of the precise nature of the intruder’s
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
rights. He knew his want of money, and
with a paper carefully drawn, releasing all claim to
the estate of Mr. Eagleton, he returned home. He
soon had an interview with Ellis, and offered him
a certain sum, to be paid upon the spot, if he would
sign the instrument. He refused at first, peremptorily,
then asked an advance in the offer, and, at
last, finding that he could do no better, put his name
to the paper, coolly pocketed the money and left
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The estate was soon settled. Their native place
was connected with associations so painful that
they were glad to leave it, and in a few weeks they
were quietly domiciled in the city where I found
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a year, at least, after the death of Mr.
Eagleton, when early one morning on the high-road
leading to the village in which he had lived, the
dead body of a wealthy farmer was found by some
one passing by. It bore marks of violence which
none could doubt. A murder had been committed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Excitement burned in the town and in the neighborhood.
Within the memory of the oldest inhabitant
no similar act of violence had been committed.
Suspicion first ran riot, then settled, as if
by common agreement, upon George Ellis. It was
not strange that conjecture should have taken that
course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellis did not leave the town when he last turned
from the door which had twice cast him off. He
remained, for the simple reason that he knew not
where else to go. He lurked about its vilest places
and made low friends by his ill-gotten money. But
he soon lost both, and yet he stayed. No one knew
how he lived. He crossed the paths of citizens in
strange places and unusual hours. He went in and
came out like no one else. His worst companions
had shaken him off. He was the very one upon
whom any crime would have been first cast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt the suspicion and tried to live it down.
His efforts gave it a new stimulus. He braved
public opinion, sought public places, became noisy
and obtrusive. Many thought this sudden change
of manner justified his arrest, and so strong became
at last the feeling against him that the suggestion
was followed. He was seized without oath, examined
without effect, and committed in the end to
await his trial upon evidence that would have convicted
half of the community. Public opinion is
hard law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>New facts came out. The prisoner had been
seen abroad much later than usual on the night before
the murder. He had mentioned it to some one
early on the morning after it had been committed.
His manner, it was said, had been more hurried and
excited for a day or two before it occurred. What
a silly thing suspicion is. How easy to feed it. And
yet these and a dozen other like stories were passed
about by grave men in eager gossip. The net was
cast and brought in of every kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An indictment was found; who dare have said
nay. The trial drew near—it came too slowly.
Yet all this while nothing serious or substantial had
come to light in any way connecting Ellis with
the deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He protested his innocence firmly and without
contradiction. His counsel encouraged him. Public
opinion was not to try him. The flimsy rumors that
had ruled the market-house and the tavern door
would be winnowed and sifted. No conviction
could be had upon such testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day came, and in a court-room thronged as
it had never been before, a jury was sworn with
much difficulty—for few had not formed or expressed
an opinion. This done, the trial proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The testimony began after a short opening. First
in order, in grave detail of examination and cross-examination,
came that which bore upon the finding
of the body—its appearance—the wounds it showed—the
opinion of medical men that such <a id='wound'></a>wounds
caused the death, and the nature of the weapon
used. It was in evidence that a small and peculiar
pistol had been found not far off from the place
where the murdered man lay. It had no doubt been
fired close to his head, for the upper part of it was
entirely blown away. The pockets had been rifled,
and all that was valuable about his person had been
removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed the proof connecting the prisoner
with the crime. It consisted entirely of such facts
as those we have given, and even these presented
with doubt and contradiction. The last witness
had retired from the box, and the counsel for the
state was about to close his case, when a bustle was
heard in the crowd, and a pedlar with his pack upon
his back, forced on by the crowd, made his way toward
the bar. A bailiff stopped him, when a citizen
well known in the town, and who had from the first
been earnest in his voice against the accused,
stepped forward and spoke to the officer. The pack
was removed, and the pedlar was admitted within
the enclosure in which the prosecuting attorney sat.
An earnest conversation followed. Ellis and his
counsel were anxious, but not more so than their
professional opponent, who was a gentleman of
high principle, and a humanity unusual in such a
station. The latter now rose and asked permission
to be absent for a short time, and taking the pistol
from the table, he beckoned the new comer to
follow him, and left the court-room. They were
absent some twenty minutes, and when they returned
the stranger was put at once into the witness
box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His story was simple, and no severity of cross-examination
could baffle its force or procure a contradiction.
He had sold that very pistol to the
prisoner, whom he had met in the public road two
days before the murder. Ellis he could not mistake—the
weapon he could swear to on his deathbed.
He was in the village now by accident, had
come to the trial from curiosity, had made an unguarded
explanation when he first saw the accused,
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
and in spite of his unwillingness to give testimony
in a case of life and death, he had been forced up
by those around. This was simple, but direct and
damning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness had one of those heavy faces which
are the most difficult to decipher. Ellis scrutinized
him closely. He was confident he had never seen
him before. Sick at heart, and bewildered by what
he deemed a gratuitous and wanton effort to swear
away his life, yet powerless in the grasp of <a id='vill3'></a>villainy,
he turned from him, and as he did so his eye fell
on another face, whose glance drove the blood
throbbing to his heart. It was the face of Antonio.
With a fevered brow and a dry tongue he leaned
toward his counsel, and hastily whispered his fears.
It was too late now to ferret out a conspiracy, and
when he turned again the Spaniard was gone, and
that impenetrable witness stood coolly in the box
awaiting his dismissal. God of compassion! he was
taken in the snare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An agony to be loose when no hand was on him;
a frenzy to be free when no bars were round him.
Was he going mad? Then a film came over his
mind thicker—thicker. He buried his face in his
hands, and the veins upon his forehead were swollen
and knotted. Memories went over him like the
rushing of a host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence on the part of the state now closed.
None was offered on behalf of the prisoner. The
counsel summed up the evidence;—the charge of
the court followed;—the jury retired, soon returned,
and their foreman gave in a verdict. Guilty!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellis had undermined his constitution by excesses.
But from the instant when that word fell upon his
ear a decay, far less gradual, began in mind and
body. He did not faint or weep; he did not reason,
resist, or complain. The withering blight of years
came upon him in a few short days, but no eye saw
the change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some weeks after the trial that as Eagleton
glanced over one of the morning papers, a paragraph
met his eye which riveted his attention. It was an
announcement of the execution of George Ellis, to
take place in a month from that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was deeply shocked. Feelings struggled in
his breast that were never there before. He asked
himself questions until then never suggested.
Might not this result have been averted? Had his
conscience no one weak point in all the history of
his course toward one over whom a parent had
thrown the sacred protection of a dying trust? Had
they done the outcast a justice that could bear the
light of humanity as well as of reason? Was there
no shadow of selfishness in the motives that had
twice cast him upon the world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>One duty, however, was clear. He could not let
the wretched man die alone. He must see him if it
were only to stand by him on the scaffold. That
over, a dying parent’s prayer would no longer appeal
to him, except perhaps to bury the dead out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He plead business to his sister, and started on his
way. Night and day he traveled, those solemn
questions still communing with his spirit. He was
a deep-hearted man, and sorrow had made his sensibilities
sore. Night and day—night and day. If
he dreamed, George Ellis was there, straight and
handsome, his dark eye softened into sympathy, and
Mary on his arm—a lovely bride; and suddenly the
scene changed, and a creature bloated and miserable
stood upon a scaffold, with a sea of heads heaving
before it, and its bloodshot gaze upon him, not in
anger, but in mournful rebuke;—and again it was
George Ellis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached the town, and was admitted to his
cell. The prisoner was pale and emaciated, and
a sluggish apathy was in his air, which seemed
indifference to life. He recognized Eagleton, but
greeted him coldly, and declined all his proffered
visits. And yet there was no resentment in his
manner. The misery of life had burnt away the
wished for rest and quiet sleep. Before Henry left
him, however,—abruptly, and without question, but
with an energy that appeared to wake up for the
purpose, and a call upon God to attest his truth—he
swore that he was innocent of the crime he was to
expiate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagleton left him in deep emotion. He busied
himself at once in collecting information as to the
murder, the trial, and the ground of conviction. He
made diligent search for the strange witness, and
strove for a pardon or reprieve. It was in vain. A
sentence was a sterner thing then than now, and the
verdict of twelve men more inviolable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day fixed for the execution arrived. It was
near noon when a gloomy procession left the prison
gate and wound through the opening crowd to the
foot of the gallows. The scaffold bore at last the
prisoner, the sheriff, a deputy, found at the last moment
to relieve him from the hateful duty of taking
life, a clergyman, and Eagleton. The first was still,
stupid, and indifferent. No sound escaped him as
his irons were removed, and his hands bound; no
voice passed his lips as time was given him to bid
those around farewell. The man of God knelt in
prayer, then rose and fell back. The executioner
approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend watched him with intense interest. He
was masked. His manner was singular, and a
deep excitement pervaded his movements. A
strange and unaccountable suspicion of the man
crept over Eagleton, he knew not why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised the cap which was to shut out the
world forever from the wretched being by his side.
But before it rested on the head for which it was intended,
he who held it seemed to have a purpose to
fulfil. He leaned quickly forward, whispered in that
passive ear, and for a single instant raised his mask.
Eyes of fire glared from under it. It was Antonio
once more. What he said no mortal knows; but if
ages of burning malignity and pent passion can be
distilled into one word, that word, no doubt, was in
the prisoner’s ear. He started and looked up, and
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
a shudder passed over his frame. Then, in one
instant, all his apathy was gone, and he struggled
like a madman to free his hands. The Spaniard
saw his error, and strove to retrieve it. But the
frantic exertions of the prisoner foiled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagleton himself could be passive no longer. He
had seen it all, and felt that the sudden change that
had passed upon Ellis was not the mere change of
fear grown riotous at the last. He seized the
stranger, tore off his mask, and called for aid.
Quicker than thought the executioner drew a pistol
from his breast and fired it. The prisoner fell upon
the scaffold. He then quietly surrendered himself.
As the sheriff, until now transfixed by the scene,
approached and drew from the hand of his strange
deputy the weapon just used, he started at its resemblance
to the one which had been produced at
the trial, the peculiar marks of which were strongly
impressed upon his memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intervention of those who could act with
authority was procured. There was clearly a plot
against the prisoner’s life, in which the strange witness
was the first actor, and the executioner the
second. Humanity rode down the sharp points of
legal form. The scaffold was soon cleared. The
multitude retired. The gallows fell beneath axe and
hammer; and the only evidence of that stirring scene
was the grass trampled by the eager crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend next day visited Antonio in his cell.
He asked after his victim, and being told that the
wound was mortal, and that he was dying, made a
full confession. He had escaped from his prison;—<span class='it'>he</span>
had been the murderer;—the witness was his
tool;—he had gone upon the scaffold to finish his
revenge, and to glut his passion with the agonies of
a frightful death. It was singular, but for some
reason best known to himself, he left Eagleton in
ignorance of the cause of his malice, and of the
crime at ——.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellis did not die. His wound was thought to be
mortal—it was only severe. He recovered, but
his mind was dead, and Eagleton took him to his
own home, harmless and passive as a new-born
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are all gone now—the brother, the sister,
and her idiot husband. The green sod has grown
for years over their graves, and I tell their story in
the full conviction that no heart will be wounded,
and no delicacy hurt by a recital of facts which to
me are full of interest.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. JANE L. SWIFT.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the vast number of individuals continually
visiting the regions of the old world, how few are
prepared by an enlightened education and a cultivated
taste, to appreciate its strong claims upon
the admiration of the traveler. A love of the
beautiful in nature, and a veneration for the ancient
in art, may combine to give a glowing interest to
each step that is taken upon the soil of older climes;
but to minds that feel how much we owe to the
early annals of those climes—how the accumulated
treasures of historic lore have pointed out the quicksands
of legislation—how experience has sounded
its alarm from the rocks upon which nation after
nation has struck and gone down; to minds that
feel how time has traced upon the chart of the
world’s destiny a warning record for those that come
after—the government and institutions, the splendor
and the decay, the rise and the downfall of the
countries over which they wander, cannot fail to
awaken the deepest interest, and to imbue with
the holiness of truth the associations that must
continually arise. It is one thing to have read
the history of a country—to have a knowledge of
its successive kings, emperors, or rulers; to know
the results of its convulsions and its battles; to be
able to date the events that have crowned with
glory or branded with ignominy its name—and it is
another thing to have digested the information thus
obtained; to have acquired a succinct view of the
bearing of social and political institutions upon the
genius of the people existing under them; and to
have become acquainted with the predominant influences
which conducted that country to its ascent,
or hastened it to its decline. A noble structure is
left for us to gaze upon; a relic of by-gone ages, full
of rents and fissures, and bearing upon its time-worn
towers the ivy of decay. It speaks to us of
the course of empire, of the march of intellect, of
the sway of mind, of the abuse of power, of the
horrors of war, of the extinction of nations. It
stands as a beacon to enlighten the world’s rulers;
to teach them that what has been shall be; and to
display its warning torch for the Future in the history
of the Past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>History is to the mental what Revelation is to the
spiritual vision. The former clears away the darkness
which rests upon our perceptions with regard
to the well-being and destiny of nations; the latter
dispels the cloud which hangs over the unevangelized
world with regard to the well-being and destiny
of man. It does not require a moment’s thought
to be convinced, that he who visits classic ground
with a mind conversant with and delighting in the
glowing pages of ancient lore, will experience an
enjoyment tenfold to that of him who finds all things
new, and who, content with the attraction of novelty,
neither knows nor cares to know of the mighty
deeds that have cursed or consecrated its soil.
True, there are sunny landscapes smiling for him,
and works of art beautiful in their decay around him;
but they cannot be to him as familiar things, for he
had perchance never heard of their existence until
he gazed upon them. The charm of association
can beautify and hallow the most barren spot. What
may it not do, then, when its golden hue is cast
upon the monuments of former greatness—monuments
crumbling to their fall, but speaking of a
people, and of a grandeur, which centuries ago
had passed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thoughts like these were floating through the
mind of a young traveler, as he gazed out of the
window of the post chaise that was rapidly approaching
the place of his destination. He was the
eldest son of a wealthy English commoner, who,
having traced in the early years of his child the
bright promise of a noble intellect, had assiduously
applied himself to its cultivation and improvement.
A man of no inconsiderable literary attainment himself
he could fully appreciate the advantages of a
highly finished education, and as the mind of his
son daily developed its natural endowments, it became
his delight and pride to direct that young
mind in its pursuit of knowledge. As Arthur Melburn
advanced toward manhood, the energies of
his nature seemed concentrated upon the all-absorbing
love of study; and in the classic writers of
Greece and Rome, he found a never failing source
of interest and of pleasure. A sojourn in those
regions of former splendor had been from boyhood
the brightest day-dream of his young spirit; and
often had that spirit taken its airy flight among the
scenes described by the matchless pens of Grecian
and Roman historians. In the noble, heart-stirring
legends of ancient Rome, he learned to feel a veneration
for the clime and for the people which had
been marked out for such exalted destinies; while
in the shade of the academic grove he bent with
profound admiration before the master-minds of
philosophers and sages. Upon his return from the
University of Cambridge, at the age of three-and-twenty,
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
he set out upon his long anticipated tour,
well prepared to enjoy and to appreciate the beautiful
in nature, the wonderful in art, and the mighty
in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unlike the generality of earth’s gifted ones, Arthur
Melburn possessed a well balanced, well regulated
judgment, with a discretion beyond his years. Yet,
as every character must have its own tinge of imperfection,
he possessed that chilling reserve of disposition
which characterizes his nation, and was
too prone to seek his enjoyment in himself, without
due regard to the claims of those around him. This
feeling, so apt to degenerate into confirmed selfishness,
had frequently been the subject of earnest
expostulation between the father and son; but not
until Arthur Melburn had visited the gay <span class='it'>salons</span> of
Paris, and the still gayer coteries of Vienna, was he
aware how unpopular and repulsive such an <span class='it'>abord</span>
must be. The conviction thus forced upon him,
soon wrought a change in the young Englishman’s
address; and although the “so far shalt thou come
and no further” of old England still clung to him,
yet he was in every respect the accomplished
scholar, the courteous and polished man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bright and lovely day in October, such
an one as gives elasticity to the frame, and tinges
the cheek with a ruddier glow. The sun was declining
in the heavens, and streaks of golden light
fell upon the landscape, which met the traveler’s
eye as he reached the heights near Boccano, and
looked for the first time upon the domes and towers
of Rome. It is not easy to describe the varied
associations that poured their tide of hallowed memories
into his mind. He was not an enthusiast.
He was one who felt deeply, although he felt calmly;
yet an attentive observer might have marked a faint
flush pass over his brow, while the veins of his
temples swelled, and his eye dilated as he gazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young Italian had been his companion on the
route from Florence, and our traveler had become
singularly interested in his new acquaintance. He
was a native of Rome, possessing all the fire and
passionate ardor of that clime, combined with a
melancholy that seemed ill-suited to his years. He
was slight, and of small stature, but with a countenance
of intellectual beauty that could not be surpassed.
The rich, glossy curls fell upon a brow as
white as ivory; and the dark eye gleamed from beneath
that brow as if it would pierce into your soul.
But his cheek was very, very pale, and the chiselled
lips had lost their ruby hue. He was evidently in
declining health, and Arthur Melburn felt his heart
warm toward the unknown but interesting companion
of his journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The air is chilly, too chilly I fear for you,” said
Melburn kindly; “let me draw up the window, or
else change seats with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” replied the young Italian, “the air
does me good—it strengthens me; and see,” he
added, “we are nearly at our journey’s end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust,” returned Melburn with a smile, “that
the acquaintance so agreeably commenced between
us may not be discontinued upon our arrival in
Rome. I anticipate making a stay of many weeks
there, and it will give me unfeigned satisfaction to
renew our intercourse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crimson flush passed over the pallid cheek of
the Italian as he warmly grasped Melburn’s hand
and said, “Yes, yes, I have felt my spirit yearn
toward you with an unaccountable sympathy. I
have loved but few, and fewer still have cared for
me. <a id='yours'></a>Yours is a brighter and a happier destiny than
mine. What have you to gain by knowing me? Yet
I would gladly look upon you as a friend—indeed,
indeed I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melburn cordially pressed the feverish hand
within his own; and giving his address to the Italian,
asked for his in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Giovanni Rosa, and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Englishman uttered an exclamation of surprise,
and said, “You are not, then, entirely unknown
to me. I have heard of you as the most promising
of the young painters of Italy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” sighed the Italian, “to win immortality for
the name of Giovanni Rosa would reconcile me to
life, barren and blasted as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too young to speak thus despondingly
of life, Signor Rosa; believe me, all have their
peculiar trials, and with an honorable career before
you, these trials should be met and overcome. We
will talk of this hereafter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage stopped; Melburn alighted at the
door of his hotel, and, after arranging an interview
for the morrow, the two newly made friends
separated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a great disappointment to our young
traveler to find, upon his arrival at Rome, that his
uncle’s family, which he had expected to meet
there, had left but a week or two before. He was
to have joined their party; but, owing to the miscarriage
of his letters, they had proceeded on their
journey, leaving information for him that they
should soon retrace their steps, and probably pass
the winter in Rome. After some deliberation, Melburn
concluded that it was as well for him to remain
and wait their return, although his heart beat more
quickly as he thought of his long anticipated meeting
with his beautiful cousin, Alice Templeton, whom
he had not seen for more than a year. He had
cherished a preference for her from early boyhood;
but as they had met rarely, and then at long intervals,
that preference had not yet acquired the
strength of love. Yet there were pure, sweet memories
connected with her; for in childhood he had
often smoothed her golden curls as her little head
lay upon his bosom, and in later years he had seen
the mantling blush overspread her countenance, as
he pressed the kiss of meeting or of parting upon
her brow. But he was in Rome—this reconciled
him to the delay; and as his mind wandered back
again to its treasured lore, he felt that he trod the
courts of a temple consecrated to dead empires,
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
and that the very dust beneath his feet was hallowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accompanied by the enthusiastic Italian, with
what exquisite satisfaction did he visit the ruined
monuments of the ancient mistress of the world, the
queen of nations! How time flew by, as from
spot to spot he traced the steps of desolation and
decay; and when memory reverted to the three
hundred triumphs that had been celebrated within
the walls of the seven-hilled city, he felt how hollow
and frail a thing was the pageantry of earth. The
empty sepulchres, the ruined temples, the mouldering
arches, the tottering piles—these were but the
scattered fragments of Rome’s glory; the broken
and tarnished jewels of her matchless crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on a mild, beautiful afternoon, about a
month after his arrival, that Arthur Melburn sat
alone in the studio of the young painter. They had
made an engagement to visit the Coliseum together
by moonlight; and Melburn, not finding him at
home, concluded to wait for his return. As he
looked upon the pictures which the glowing pencil
of Rosa had traced upon the canvas, he saw how
each bore the stamp of the wild beauty that characterized
the mind of the painter. In his designs
there was a dreamy mystery and gloom that seemed
to cast a shadow upon the sunny tints; and made
you feel as if storm and calm, hope and despair,
were struggling for the mastery. One picture, a
mere sketch, soon attracted the attention of Melburn.
There was a wild torrent rushing over dark
and pointed rocks. Upon one side of the stream
was a towering oak whose leaves were still green
and luxuriant, although it had been riven to its very
centre by the thunderbolt; while its scorched and
blackened trunk stood in strong contrast with the
fresh verdure that surrounded it. Upon the stream,
where all was calm, there floated a little bark,
moored safely in its glassy haven, with a female
figure reclining listlessly at its prow; while, driving
on among the rocks and whirlpools, and hurrying
to destruction, was another boat, in which knelt the
figure of a man. His face was turned toward the
serene and quiet haven, but he was not aware of
the perils that surrounded him; for his gaze was
riveted upon that vision of beauty, and the oar,
fallen from his hand, had already been carried over
the edge of the fearful torrent. Melburn was so
intent contemplating the powerful effect produced
by the lights and shades of the painter’s pencil, that
he did not notice his entrance until he stood with
folded arms beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is thus with life, is it not, Melburn?” murmured
the soft, low tones of Giovanni. “A few
sunny hours upon the glassy bosom of its stream,
and then the threatening waves and foaming surges
bear us wildly on. In the distance is some bright
vision—the Egeria of our hearts—embodying all
that youth, and hope, and love can sigh for. Alas!
the unattained; how it woos and mocks, but to woo
and mock again. We are but the sport of destiny;
and as that destiny grows dim and dark, fate looks
on with a smile, and we are hurried into the still
waters of oblivion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melburn turned his calm eye upon the excited
countenance of the speaker. “Giovanni, life is indeed
a troubled stream, and man is launched in a
frail bark upon its waves; but the means to stem
those waves, and to guide that bark, are given him,
and if those means be cast aside, why call it destiny
that hurries him to destruction? Your matchless
picture has called up stern and solemn thoughts.
Look at it, Giovanni; the oars are fallen overboard,
the rudder is useless at the helm, the compass
vibrates, but meets not the eye it was given to
guide. Is the recklessness that suffers the vessel
with its priceless freight to near the torrent’s brink—is
that recklessness destiny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we not what we are, Melburn, by an inevitable
necessity? Can I change the course of events,
which in themselves are fixed and unalterable?
As soon may you gather up the burning fluid of the
thunderbolt in your hand, as arrest or turn aside
the decrees of fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Giovanni; since you have entered, the
heavens are darkened by an approaching tempest.
Yonder spire out-tops the surrounding buildings,
and presents a mark for the lightning’s unerring aim.
But see! upon its point there is an iron rod, and
that rod can preserve the magnificent structure
from desolation. Would it be well to leave it unprotected,
and call it destiny that would at some
future day make it a heap of smouldering ruins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied the Italian despondingly; “but
man, man is ever fulfilling <span class='it'>his</span> unalterable destiny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are only a superficial disciple of the fatalists,”
answered Melburn, smiling; “for you have
failed to cultivate the equanimity and indifference
to fate which they teach. Believe me, dear Giovanni,
man is not a puppet in the hands of fate.
He is a rational, accountable being, destined for
immortality; dependent, I admit, upon a wise over-ruling
Providence for the allotment of good or evil
in this life; but he may of his own free will abuse
the good to his destruction, or make the evil profitable
to his improvement. As the warm breeze of
the south enervates the frame it blows upon, so
would a life without trial rob manhood of the discipline
that braces and nerves the soul to godlike
strength. As each difficulty or disappointment
comes upon us, we should strive to hear the voice
that spoke to Constantine in his memorable vision,
‘In this, overcome.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Italian grasped the hand of Melburn; “Speak
on,” he murmured, “for your words fall in gentle
tones upon my heart, and the slumbering memories
of other years, when a mother’s voice lulled me to
repose, are crowding upon my soul. Speak on, for
holier thoughts come at your bidding—thoughts of
a being who was not always shrouded in blackness
and tempest—thoughts long buried in the ashes of a
consuming ambition and a hopeless love. Yet
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
there are moments, Melburn, when a ‘still small
voice’ is heard above the storm of earthly passions,
and the weary spirit yearns to catch the blessed
accents as they fall; but the blast sweeps on, and the
voice is drowned in the contending din.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is your misfortune, Giovanni, to possess the
keen sensibilities, and the finely strung nerves of
genius. You worship the beautiful, and you feel
the slightest discord in the harmony of your emotions
with an intensity unknown to mankind in
general. You perceive quickly, you appreciate
vividly, you love passionately. But the pearls of
existence are strung upon a slender thread, and the
anxious grasp that would secure, too often scatters
them in the dust. You are a child of impulse, and
the same fire that kindles the flame of ambition
within your soul, is searing your spirit with its
fervid glow. If the dew of heaven water the
parched flower, it will bloom again; and the dew of
a better, purer hope will revive the blossom of happiness
in your heart, Giovanni.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! never! the wilted flower may revive,
but when the worm has been busy at the root,
what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The broken spirit may lean upon Omnipotence,
Giovanni. He who holds in his hands the destinies
of worlds, and whose infinite mind originated the
eternal mysteries of the universe, he supports the
sparrow on the wing, and it falls not to the ground
without his knowledge. Shall man, the most
glorious of his works, the image of himself, the
denizen of immortality, shall man pine under the
weight of his earthly fetters, and find no ark of
refuge? Forbid it, Heaven!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence of some minutes ensued, and a burning
drop fell upon Melburn’s hand, which was clasped
in that of the Italian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain, which had been falling in torrents,
ceased, the clouds cleared away, and the last rays
of the setting sun streamed in bright effulgence as it
sank to its repose. Slowly faded the gorgeous tints
that had robed the sky in glory, and as the drapery
of heaven darkened in its hue, here and there a
faint star peeped out, and then the full-orbed moon
shed her pure and mystic light upon the scene. At
this moment, beneath the window where they sat,
appeared a young Italian girl, who, after gazing for
an instant upon the face of Giovanni, struck with a
master-touch the guitar which she held, and poured
forth, in a voice of exquisite melody, the following
wild strain:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next moment she had disappeared, and Melburn
turned to look at Giovanni. His head was
bowed upon his hand, and he breathed quickly, as
if overpowered by suppressed emotion. There was
a long and heavy pause. “Melburn,” said he at
last, “have you ever loved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stern, cold expression passed over the countenance
of the young Englishman, which did not
escape the quick eye of Rosa, and he resumed; “A
portion of the veil has been lifted which hides from
you the secret of my unhappiness. Despise me not,
Melburn, when I tell you that I have ceased to love
<span class='it'>her</span>. Why, why was I born to bring blight upon
others as well as upon myself? Left an orphan at
an early age, penniless and friendless, I have struggled
thus far through life, just earning the bread that
supports me. Burning with an ambition to excel in
the godlike art I worship, I have drained but one
or two scanty drops of fame for years of intense
study. I have seen influence and patronage draw
out of obscurity talent less deserving than mine,
while I have been left to grovel in the dust of neglect
and poverty. With bitterness of spirit I have tasted
the injustice of the world, and its bought smiles
have withered almost to the root the hopes that I
dared to cherish. In the midst of my loneliness
and sorrow there beamed a vision of comfort upon
my soul; and the impassioned being, whose song
just met your ear, wreathed a charm around my
heart which I mistook for love. You of a colder
clime know not the fearful fire that gives intensity
to every emotion, and makes the life-blood rush
with the impetuosity of a torrent. Conventional
prejudices would make you judge harshly of the
love that overpowers reason, propriety, and prudence;
but Bianca was a child of nature, and in
loving me, she cast all her heart’s treasure into my
arms. We were both poor—we could not marry;
but she was to have been my wife. Fate threw in
my way another from your own cold clime. Ah,
the beautiful! how I worshiped it in her. We met
at the Vatican, where she was copying a sketch by
Rubens. A celebrated painter introduced me to
her. She visited my pictures, and the meed of approval
that fell from her lips sank into my soul.
She was gentle, with all the winning gentleness of
woman; but the chaste snow was not more cold.
I gazed upon her beauty as we gaze upon a pure
and distant star; and as each speaking lineament
told of elevated desires, and proud aspirations, I
bent in adoration at her shrine, and laid my offering
there. We had met frequently; and although I
feared that my love was hopeless, still I could not
tear myself from the fascination of her presence.
She saw, with a woman’s quick perception, that I
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
loved her deeply; and she strove to destroy by
coldness the illusion that might be fatal to my peace.
I could not bear it; it was better to know the worst.
We were left alone one evening, and with trembling
lips and incoherent words, I strove to tell her of my
love. She did not suffer me to proceed, but kindly
took my hand in hers and said, ‘Signor Rosa, from
childhood my heart has been another’s.’ Darkness
came over me, and the sable pall will never be
drawn aside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused for a moment, and then continued; “I
would not, could not see Bianca. The romance of
life was at an end. I shut myself up among the
creations of my pencil, but they failed to awaken
my spirit from its lethargy; and I find the energies
of my soul withering daily, and my frame consuming
with the fire that will not be quenched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears glistened in the eyes of the sensitive Italian,
and he hurried on. “I love you, Melburn; you
would save me from myself, and you have made
me feel that there is disinterested kindness in humanity.
There have been times, my friend, when
a whispering demon seemed urging me to rid myself
of the load that oppressed me—‘it is but a drop of
opiate—it is but the keen point of the dark blue
steel—it is but the flash of a moment, and all will
be over.’ Then there came thoughts of the dread
loneliness and degradation of the grave—perhaps
the judgment! and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giovanni,” said Melburn solemnly, interrupting
him, “brave not the Most High. Life is a precious
deposit, and it is not for man to interfere with the
will of Omnipotence. Suicide is the crime of a
coward, perpetrated in moral darkness; it is a crime
which leaves not a moment for repentance or for
pardon, but ushers the blood-stained soul unshriven
into the presence of its God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shudder passed over the frame of the Italian as
he drew from his bosom a small poignard of exquisite
workmanship; “Take it—take it, Melburn,”
he exclaimed, “you have saved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lingering pressure of the hand was Melburn’s
only answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now too late for them to think of visiting the
Coliseum—besides, their minds were not in a state
to do so; and after making an appointment for the
morrow, they separated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Melburn reached his room at the hotel, he
was delighted to find letters from his relatives, who
had just arrived in Naples from Sicily, announcing
their intention of remaining there for some weeks,
and begging him to join their party immediately.
Nothing could have happened more opportunely;
for, for some days past, he had been thinking
seriously of setting out to overtake them wherever
they might be. And then the image of Alice—how
often did it mingle in his dreams, and haunt his
waking hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day he spent with Giovanni Rosa in
wandering among the ruins of Rome; and it was
with sincere regret that the enthusiastic Italian heard
of the contemplated journey to Naples. “You will
forget me, Melburn,” he said sorrowfully; “the
remembrance of me will be but as a passing shadow,
while you will live within my heart. But you will
return, will you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Giovanni—perhaps soon. At all events, I
shall spend some time again in Rome before I bid
adieu to beautiful Italy forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” exclaimed Rosa, as he grasped Melburn’s
hand at parting; “I will remember your
counsel—I will strive ‘in this to overcome.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, Rosa, for my sake, and for your future
fame, struggle on, it will not be in vain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Italian gazed at the receding form of the
young Englishman until it disappeared; and then
hurrying home, he rushed to his room and burst
into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the evening of the second day after his
departure from Rome that Arthur Melburn arrived
in Naples. Travel-worn and covered with dust as
he was, he sought instantly the <span class='it'>salon</span> where he expected
to meet his relatives. No one was there
but Alice; and as she rose hastily to meet him, he
could scarcely believe that the beautiful being before
him was the gay, romping cousin of earlier days.
What the countenance had lost of ruddiness and
glow, it had gained in the intellectual, I may almost
say the spiritual expression that now characterized
it. Eloquent thought had stamped a serene loveliness
upon her brow, and feeling had robbed the
cheek of its roses to impart a softer lustre to her
eye. Arthur clasped her hands in his, gazed at her,
hesitated, and then raised one fair hand to his lips.
“Dear Alice,” he said, and as those tones fell upon
her ear, a crimson blush passed over her face, and
then left it paler than before. And what were the
feelings of Melburn? Ah, at such moments how
memories throng upon the overpowered heart, concentrating
in one glowing point the beautiful rays
that have illumined life, and fastening as with a
diamond rivet the slender links of love’s frail chain.
Frail? Ay, frail; unless the hallowed influences
of years have given to it enduring strength, and
then it must be a power almost super-human that
can sever it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much there was to hear, how much to tell;
and as each member of the family welcomed the
new comer, how pleasant it was to feel almost at
home again, though in a land of strangers. In the
society of Alice, whose mind was capable of appreciating
his superior attainments, Melburn visited all
the places worthy of notice in and around Naples;
and each day, as it verged to its decline, added
some memorial of happiness to be garnered in
their hearts. Theirs was not a love blinded by passion,
exaggerated in its impulses, and consuming to
ashes while it burned; but it was the genial ray
lent by Heaven to gladden with its pure light the
darker pathways of this world. It was love such as
an angel might have looked upon, without feeling that
the spirit had been tinged by aught of earthly stain.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
Week after week rolled on with a rapidity almost
incredible, for time to the happy is winged with
swifter pinions, and the winter had nearly passed
away before they returned to Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melburn’s first visit was to the studio of the young
painter. His cheek was paler, and his frame more
attenuated, but the expression of his countenance
was less wild and haggard. In the endearing epithets
of his sweet language he welcomed the traveler,
and gazed upon him with a melancholy tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Melburn,” he said, after their first congratulations
had been exchanged, “ah, Melburn, I began
to fear that I should never look upon your face
again. It would have grieved me to descend into
the cold, dark grave without having once more
heard the tones of sympathy and kindness. I have
struggled to smother the contending passions within
my breast; I have suffered; but I have been calm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You apply yourself too closely to your art, Giovanni;
why not abandon it for a time, and seek renovated
health in change of air, and change of scene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall carry the same heart with me, Melburn;
it is too late. I feel that I am dying—the withering
blight of years has struck home. But let us not
dwell upon that now. It does me good to see you
once more; and to feel that I have one friend in the
wide world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Giovanni,” answered the young Englishman,
“the bond of friendship has become strong
between us, although but a few months ago we met
as strangers. I know not what mysterious sympathy
attracted us to each other, but I felt from the
moment I saw you, as if there was a connecting
link in our destinies. An impulse which I cannot
define induced me to offer you the seat in my traveling
carriage, as I was leaving Florence; and when
we reached Rome, I could not think of parting from
you as a stranger. I see with pain that your health
is failing; dear Rosa, let me persuade you to accompany
me next month to England. Circumscribed
means need be no obstacle, for I have
wealth enough to spare; nay, interrupt me not—he
is not my friend who would refuse to receive so
small an obligation at my hands. The journey
might restore your waning strength, and after a
residence of a few months there, you might return
to your country with a renovated frame and a happier
mind. Since I left you, Giovanni, I have become
affianced to one whom I have long loved;
and she will unite with me, I am sure, in striving
to make you happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you joy, Melburn,” exclaimed the Italian
with much feeling; “God grant that she may be
worthy of you. But, my friend, I cannot accept
your kind offer. I would die here—here in the
beautiful land that gave me birth; surrounded by
the objects I have worshiped, and on the spot where I
first met her. Here must be my grave; and perhaps
at some future day she may revisit this sunny clime,
and remember the heart that beat and broke for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melburn saw that it was useless to contend for
the present against the morbid melancholy which
seemed to have settled upon the spirit of the painter,
and he began to converse upon lighter themes. All
proved powerless to win him from his gloomy abstraction;
at length rousing himself as if from a
dreamy reverie, he said, “Happiness is attained by
some; you are happy, Melburn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Giovanni, I am happy; but I do not look
for an unchequered path in this world. I know
that cares, anxieties, and afflictions fall sooner or
later to the lot of all; and I would be prepared to
lose the blessings I enjoy by not loving them too
well. A just balance in which to weigh the objects
of fluctuating desire is necessary to our forming
just views of their value; and will prevent our
giving undue preponderance to those which are
secondary or trivial in themselves. We are so apt
to surround some wished for boon, while unattained,
with vague anticipations of delight, which the possession
too often fails to realize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true, Melburn; but many a heart lives
on hope that never enjoys fruition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melburn smiled as he answered, “In gazing upon
the forbidden garden that crowns some lofty hill
inaccessible to us, we may forget the fruits and
flowers that are lying in profusion at our feet, untasted,
unappreciated. Is it not so, Giovanni?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean the hopes that stand out in bold relief
wearing the hues of immortality; I mean the undying
yearnings of the loving heart, the glorious aspirations
of the godlike mind. Nothing short of fruition
in these can satisfy a nature such as mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Giovanni, your hope must cast its anchor
in the ‘deep profound’ of another world—it must
seek its fruition in the Eternal. You may as well
search for coral in the bowels of the earth, or for
gold in the bosom of the sea, as to seek a resting-place
for the immortal spirit in the regions of mortality.
I am not a religionist—I am not the bigoted
follower of any creed; but in the exalted aspirations
of our nature, I recognize the immaterial principle
that will hereafter assimilate us to God. It instills a
perception of the beautiful, a yearning for the good,
an appreciation of the true, that cannot be realized
in this imperfect state of existence. Looking abroad
upon the stupendous universe, I see every thing
fulfilling its destined end. Surely, these heaven-born
aspirations will not be quenched in the forgetfulness
of the grave, but, disencumbered of their
material elements, will find their completeness and
felicity in the source from which they sprung. Would
to God, my friend, that you could feel as deeply as I
do, how infinitely the interests of our future destiny
transcend those of our present state of being.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have reflected, Melburn, upon our frequent
conversations, and I feel, that had my mind been
trained as yours has been, I should not be the creature
of wayward impulse that I am. My temperament
is an unhappy one—a temperament that
might induce insanity, should my life be spared.
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
But that life is fast ebbing to its close, and I am
content to die. I have prayed that God may be
merciful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, and threw back from his brow the rich,
dark locks that had fallen over it; and assuming a
tone of cheerfulness, he said, “Tell me of your bride,
Melburn; you had not spoken to me of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melburn smiled as he answered, “She is not an
angel, Giovanni, but I think that there are few who
can be compared to my sweet Alice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alice! did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Alice Templeton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A change, a fearful change came over the face
of the Italian. The crimson blood rushed to his
brow, while his eyes glared with the furious passion
of a demon. Rage, hate, despair, were all concentrated
in the wild glance which he threw upon
Melburn, as he advanced toward him; then the
blood retreated to his heart, and left his cheek as
white as marble. His breath came short and heavy;
and he stood rooted to the spot like a thing of stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, Giovanni,” exclaimed Melburn,
“what is the matter? You appal—you terrify
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The painter grasped his hand, and dragging him
to an adjoining apartment, tore aside the snow-white
veil that hung over a picture. Melburn looked upon
the face of Alice—his Alice—the idolized love of
the Italian. But it was Alice as an angel—for her
beauty was so spiritualized, that the earthly seemed
lost in the heavenly. Melburn hid his face in his
hands for a moment; then stretching out his arms,
the stricken child of destiny rushed into them, and
sank insensible upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hour after hour passed on, and still consciousness
did not revive in that feeble frame. There was a
glimmering of life, nothing more; and as Melburn
watched beside his couch, tears, more burning than
any he had ever shed, fell upon the inanimate form
on which he gazed. “Poor Rosa,” he murmured,
“thou hast indeed been the sport of adverse circumstances.
This, then, is the link of the mysterious
chain that bound me to thee; our hearts drank at
the same fountain, and became united in the same
stream. Peace, peace to thy parting spirit. God
receive thy weary soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light of life never gleamed again. He
lingered through another day. As the veil of night
descended upon the world, the spirit of the unfortunate
Italian took its flight to the shadowy far-off
land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was midnight. Tapers were burning upon the
coffin in which lay all that remained of Giovanni
Rosa. Melburn, with two friends of the deceased,
kept a sorrowful vigil beside the clay-cold form; and
as the tedious hours crept on, the death-like silence
became almost insupportable. At length a soft step
was heard, and a female form in white glided noiselessly
to the coffin’s side. She lifted the crape that
shrouded the face beneath, and gazed fearlessly upon
the lineaments so beautiful in their repose; then
kissing the cold brow, she replaced the snowy
covering, and silently departed as she came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning they heard that Bianca was
dead. She had taken poison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <a id='chiesa'></a>Chiesa di Santa Maria is a costly monument
of marble, erected over the remains of the young
painter by his English friend. Before they returned
to England, Melburn and his betrothed visited the
spot together, fulfilling the wish of the departed,
“that she might stand beside his grave, and remember
the heart that beat and broke for her.”</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE GADWALL. (<span class='it'>Anas Strepera.</span> <span class='sc'>Wilson.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This beautiful duck is valuable on account of the
excellence of its flesh, though its expertness as a
diver renders it difficult to be shot. Its flight is
very rapid, its note like that of the Mallard, but
louder; it is fond of salines and ponds overgrown
with reeds and rushes; feeds chiefly in the morning
and evening. The Gadwall is still smaller than the
Shoveller. The male bird is in length about nineteen
inches, in breadth about thirty-three; the bill
two inches long, flat, and of a black color; markings
of the plumage exceedingly minute, giving it a sort
of appearance as if it were marked with delicate
stripe and enclosed in a net work. The crown is
dusky brown, rest of the upper half of the neck
brownish white, both thickly speckled with black;
lower part of the neck and breast dusky black, elegantly
ornamented with large, concentric semi-circles
of white scapulars, waved with lines of
white on a dusky ground; primaries ash; greater
wing coverts black, and several of the lesser
coverts, immediately above, chestnut red; speculum
white, bordered below with black, forming
three broad bands on the wing, of chestnut, black
and white; belly dull white; rump and tail coverts
black, glossed with green; tail tapering, pointed,
of a pale brown ash, edged with white; flanks
dull white, elegantly waved; tertials long, and of
a pale brown; legs orange red.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LONG-TAILED DUCK. (<span class='it'>Harelda Glacialis.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The sub-genus Harelda is in many respects analogous
to the Pochard or Scaup duck; it is a diving
duck, and makes its appearance at the same season,
and, like the latter, it is common to the colder regions
of the whole northern hemisphere. Unlike
many others of the family of ducks, it does not entirely
quit its northern haunts in winter, but resides
permanently in considerable numbers in the polar
regions. Numerous flocks, however, spread themselves
southward in the winter, from Greenland
and Hudson’s Bay as far as the coast of Carolina,
and from Iceland and Spitsbergen over Lapland,
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
the Russian dominions, Sweden, Norway, and the
northern parts of the British Isles in Europe. The
bands which visit the Orkneys appear in October,
and continue there till April. About sunset they
are seen in large companies going to and returning
from the bays in which they frequently pass the
night, making a noise which, in frosty weather, may
be heard at the distance of several miles. They
are rather scarce in England, to which they resort
only in very hard winters, and then in small straggling
parties. They fly swiftly, but seldom to a
very great distance, making a loud and singular
cry. They are extremely expert divers, feeding
almost exclusively on shell-fish. The female places
her nest among the grass near the water, and, like
the Eider duck, lines it with down from her own
body. This lining is considered by Latham equally
valuable with Eider down, but cannot be had in so
great quantity. This duck is known along the
shores of the Chesapeake and the coast of the Carolinas
by the name of South-Southerly, from its singular
cry somewhat resembling the sound of those
words. On the coast of New Jersey it bears the
appellation of Old Squaws or Old Wives. The
northern Indians call it the Hah-hah-way, and it has
elsewhere received the name of the Caccawee.
We cannot devote the space necessary to a full
description of the plumage of both sexes of this
beautiful variety of ducks, though to the scientific
sportsman it might be far from uninteresting. We
will therefore merely glance at the plumage of the
male, as given by Wilson, and pass on to notice another
of the duck family, which like the one before
us prefers the dangerous but productive ocean to
the less turbulent inland waters. The mate of the
long-tailed duck is distinguished from her partner
by wanting the lengthened tertials, and the two long
pointed feathers of the tail, and also by her size and
the rest of her plumage. The length of the male is
twenty-two inches; extent thirty inches; bill black,
crossed near the extremity by a band of orange;
tongue downy; iris dark red; cheeks and frontlet
dull dusky-drab, passing over the eye and joining
a large patch of black on the side of the neck, which
ends in dark brown; throat and rest of the neck
white; crown tufted, and of a pale cream-color;
lower part of the neck, breast, back and wings
black; scapulars and tertials pale blueish-white,
long and pointed, and falling gracefully over the
wings; the white of the lower part of the neck
spreads over the back an inch or two; the white
of the belly spreads over the sides, and nearly meets
at the rump; secondaries chestnut, forming a bar
across the wing; primaries, rump and tail coverts,
black; the tail consists of fourteen feathers, all remarkably
pointed, the two middle ones nearly four
inches longer than the others; these with the two
adjoining ones are black, the rest white; legs and
feet dusky slate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The windpipe is very curiously formed; besides
the labyrinth, which is nearly as large as the end of
the thumb, it has an expansion, immediately above
that, of double its usual diameter, which continues
for an inch and a half; this is flattened on the side
next the breast, with an oblong, window-like vacancy
in it, crossed with five narrow bars, and
covered with a thin transparent skin, like the panes
of a window; another thin skin of the same kind is
spread over the external side of the labyrinth, which
is partly of a circular form.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AMERICAN WIDGEON. (<span class='it'>Anas Americana.</span> <span class='sc'>Wilson.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Like many of the human race, the bird now before
us contrives to make for himself an easy subsistence,
by appropriating to himself the product of the exertions
of others. He is a constant attendant upon
the Canvas-Back, and is extremely fond of the tender
roots of the sea-cabbage on which the latter feeds.
He does not dive for it himself, however, but watches
the moment of the other’s rising to seize and carry
off the favorite morsel before the Canvas Back has
recovered from his immersion. The two species of
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
birds, therefore, live in a state of perpetual war, in
which the Widgeon usually comes off best; for
though beaten in a fair battle, he more than atones
for his discomfiture by his ingenuity and opportune
approaches. The Widgeons are said to be very
plenty at St. Domingo, sometimes perch on trees,
feed in company, and have a sentinel on the look-out.
They feed little during the day, but come forth from
their hiding places in the evening, when they may
be traced by their cry. They are very frequently
sold in the market of Baltimore, and their flesh is so
excellent as to command a good price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dusky Duck, (<span class='it'>Anas Obscura</span>, <span class='sc'>Wilson</span>.) is
generally known along the sea coast of New Jersey
and the neighboring country by the name of the
Black Duck, being the most common and numerous
of those of its tribe which inhabit the salt marshes.
They are extremely shy during the day, and rise in
great numbers on the most distant report of a gun,
dispersing in every direction. In calm weather
they fly so high as to be beyond the reach of shot but
they may be brought down, by a concealed gunner
in great numbers, when the wind blows hard.
They are large heavy-bodied ducks, and generally
esteemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another of the family of the ducks much esteemed
as game, is the Blue-Winged Teal, (<span class='it'>Anas Discors</span>,
<span class='sc'>Wilson</span>), a bird which ranges over the greater part
of the American continent, breeding in the vicinity
of the lakes of the St. Lawrence, and thence as far
north as the Canadian fur countries, and migrating
for food toward Massachusetts, in September, thence
south to the muddy shores of the Delaware, and in
the winter to the inundated rice-fields of the southern
states. There great numbers are taken in traps,
ingeniously contrived for the purpose. They feed
chiefly on wild rice, in the north western lakes,
and other aquatic plants. It is a shy and cautious
bird. Along the shores of the Delaware, they sit on
the mud, close to the edge of the water, so crowded
together that the gunners often kill great numbers
at a single discharge. When a flock is discovered
in this situation, the practiced sportsman runs his
boat ashore at some distance from them, and getting
out, pushes her before him over the slippery mud,
concealing himself all the while behind her; by this
method he can sometimes approach within twenty
yards of a flock, among which he generally makes
great slaughter. They fly rapidly, and when they
alight, drop down suddenly like the Snipe or Woodcock,
among the reeds or on the mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nuttall describes the plumage of the Blue-Winged
Teal with his usual accuracy, as follows: The length
of the Blue-Winged Teal is about eighteen inches;
the folded wing seven inches three lines; the bill
above one inch seven and a half lines; the tarsus
one inch two lines. In the male, the upper surface
of the head and under tail coverts are brownish-black;
a broad white crescent from the forehead to the
chin, bordered all round with black; sides of the
head and adjoining half of the neck bright lavender-purple;
base of the neck above, back, tertiaries, and
tail coverts, brownish and blackish-green. The fore
parts, including the shorter scapulars, margined and
marked with semi-ovate pale-brown bars; longer
scapulars longitudinally striped with blackish-green,
Berlin-blue, and pale brown. Lesser wing coverts
pure pale blue; greater coverts white, their bases
brown; speculum dark-green; primaries, their coverts
and the tail, liver-brown; sides of the rump, longer
under wing coverts, and axillary feathers pure white.
The under plumage pale reddish-orange, glossed
with chestnut on the breast, and thickly marked
throughout with round blackish spots, which, on the
breast and tips of the long flank feathers, change to
bars; bill bluish-black; feet yellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must now advance the time several days,
and change the scene to a distant part of the ocean;
within the tropics, indeed. The females had suffered
slight attacks of sea-sickness, and recovered from
them, and the brig was safe from all her pursuers.
The manner of Spike’s escape was simple enough,
and without any necromancy. While the steamer,
on the one hand, was standing away to the northward
and eastward, in order to head him off, and
the schooner was edging in with the island, in order
to prevent his beating up to windward of it, within
its shadows, the brig had run close round the northern
margin of the land, and hauled up to leeward of the
island, passing between it and the steamer. All
this time, her movements were concealed from the
schooner by the island itself and from the steamer,
by its shadow and dark back-ground, aided by the
distance. By making short tacks, this expedient
answered perfectly well, and, at the very moment
when the two revenue vessels met, at midnight,
about three leagues to leeward of Blok Island, the
brigantine, Molly Swash, was just clearing its most
weatherly point, on the larboard tack, and coming
out exactly at the spot where the steamer was
when first seen that afternoon. Spike stood to the
westward, until he was certain of having the island
fairly between him and his pursuers, when he went
about, and filled away on his course; running out
to sea again on an easy bowline. At sunrise the
next day he was fifty miles to the southward and
eastward of Montauk; the schooner was going into
New London, her officers and people quite chop-fallen,
and the steamer was paddling up Sound, her
captain being fully persuaded the runaways had
returned in the direction from which they had come,
and might yet be picked up in that quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather was light, just a week after the
events related in the close of the last chapter. By
this time the brig had got within the influence of the
trades, and, it being the intention of Spike to pass
to the southward of Cuba, he had so far profited by
the westerly winds, as to get well to the eastward
of the Mona Passage, the strait through which he
intended to shape his course on making the islands.
Early on that morning Mrs. Budd had taken her seat
on the trunk of the cabin, with a complacent air,
and arranged her netting, some slight passages of
gallantry, on the part of the captain, having induced
her to propose netting him a purse. Biddy was
going to and fro, in quest of silks and needles, her
mistress having become slightly capricious in her
tastes of late, and giving her, on all such occasions,
at least a double allowance of occupation. As for
Rose, she sat reading beneath the shade of the
coach-house deck, while the handsome young mate
was within three feet of her, working up his logarithms,
but within the sanctuary of his own state-room;
the open door and window of which, however,
gave him every facility he could desire to
relieve his mathematics, by gazing at the sweet
countenance of his charming neighbor. Jack Tier
and Josh were both passing to and fro, as is the
wont of stewards, between the camboose and the
cabin, the breakfast table being just then in the
course of preparation. In all other respects, always
excepting the man at the wheel, who stood within
a fathom of Rose, Spike had the quarter-deck to
himself and did not fail to pace its weather side
with an air that denoted the master and owner.
After exhibiting his sturdy, but short, person in this
manner, to the admiring eyes of all beholders, for
some time, the captain suddenly took a seat at the
side of the relict, and dropped into the following
discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The weather is moderate, Madam Budd; quite
moderate,” observed Spike, a sentimental turn
coming over him at the moment. “What I call
moderate and agreeable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better for us; the ladies are fond
of moderation, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in admiration, Madam Budd—ha! ha! ha!
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
no, not in admiration. <span class='it'>Immoderation</span> is what they
like when it comes to <span class='it'>that</span>. I’m a single man, but
I know that the ladies like admiration—mind where
you’re sheering to,” the captain said, interrupting
himself a little fiercely, considering the nature of
the subject, in consequence of Jack Tier’s having
trodden on his toe in passing—“or I’ll teach you
the navigation of the quarter-deck, Mr. Burgoo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moderation—moderation, my good captain,”
said the simpering relict. “As to admiration, I confess
that it is agreeable to us ladies; more especially
when it comes from gentlemen of sense, and intelligence,
and experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose fidgetted, having heard every word that
was said, and her face flushed; for she doubted not
that Harry’s ears were as good as her own. As for
the man at the wheel, he turned the tobacco over
in his mouth, hitched up his trousers, and appeared
interested, though somewhat mystified—the conversation
was what he would have termed “talking
dictionary,” and he had some curiosity to learn how
the captain would work his way out of it. It is
probable that Spike himself had some similar gleamings
of the difficulties of his position, for he looked
a little troubled, though still resolute. It was the
first time he had ever lain yard-arm and yard-arm
with a widow, and he had long entertained a fancy
that such a situation was trying to the best of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madam Budd, yes,” he said, “exper’ence
and sense carry weight with ’em, wherever they
go. I’m glad to find that you entertain these just
notions of us gentlemen, and make a difference between
boys and them that’s seen and known exper’ence.
For my part, I count youngsters under
forty as so much lumber about decks, as to any
comfort and calculations in keepin’ a family, as a
family <span class='it'>ought</span> to be kept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Budd looked interested, but she remained
silent on hearing this remark, as became her sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every man ought to settle in life, some time or
other, Madam Budd, accordin’ to my notion, though
no man ought to be in a boyish haste about it,” continued
the captain. “Now, in my own case, I’ve
been so busy all my youth—not that I’m very old
now, but I’m no boy—but all my younger days
have been passed in trying to make things meet, in
a way to put any lady who might take a fancy to
me⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! captain—that is <span class='it'>too</span> strong! The ladies do
not take fancies for gentlemen, but the gentlemen
take fancies for ladies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, you know what I mean, Madam
Budd, and so long as the parties understand each
other, a word dropped, or a word put into a charter-party
makes it neither stronger nor weaker. There’s
a time, howsomever, in every man’s life, when he
begins to think of settling down, and of considerin’
himself as a sort of mooring-chain, for children and
the likes of them to make fast to. Such is my natur’,
I will own; and ever since I’ve got to be intimate
in your family, Madam Budd, that sentiment has
grown stronger and stronger in me, till it has got to
be uppermost in all my idees. Bone of my bone,
and flesh of my flesh, as a body might say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Budd now looked more than interested, for
she looked a little confused, and Rose began to
tremble for her aunt. It was evident that the parties
most conspicuous in this scene were not at all
conscious that they were overheard, the intensity
of their attention being too much concentrated on
what was passing to allow of any observation without
their own narrow circle. What may be thought
still more extraordinary, but what in truth was the
most natural of all, each of the parties was so intently
bent on his, or her, own train of thought, that
neither in the least suspected any mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grown with your growth, and strengthened
with your strength,” rejoined the relict, smiling
kindly enough on the captain to have encouraged a
much more modest man than he happened to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madam Budd—very just that remark;
grown with my strength, and strengthened with my
growth, as one might say; though I’ve not done
much at growing for a good many years. Your late
husband, Capt. Budd, often remarked how very
early I got my growth, and rated me as an ‘able
bodied’ hand, when most lads think it an honor to
be placed among the ‘or’naries.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relict looked grave, and she wondered at
any man’s being so singular as to allude to a first
husband, at the very moment he was thinking of
offering himself for a second. As for herself, she
had not uttered as many words in the last four
years, as she had uttered in that very conversation,
without making some allusion to her “poor dear
Mr. Budd.” The reader is not to do injustice to the
captain’s widow, however, by supposing for a moment
that she was actually so weak as to feel any
tenderness for a man like Spike, which would be
doing a great wrong to both her taste and her judgment,
as Rose well knew, even while most annoyed
by the conversation she could not but overhear.
All that influenced the good relict was that besetting
weakness of her sex, which renders admiration
so universally acceptable, and predisposes a female,
as it might be, to listen to a suitor with indulgence
and some little show of kindness, even when resolute
to reject him. As for Rose, to own the truth,
her aunt did not give her a thought, as yet, notwithstanding
Spike was getting to be so sentimental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, your late excellent and honorable consort,
always said that I got my growth sooner than any
youngster he ever fell in with,” resumed the captain
after a short pause; exciting fresh wonder in his
companion that he <span class='it'>would</span> persist in lugging in the
“dear departed” so very unseasonably. “I am a great
admirer of all the Budd family, my good lady, and
only wish my connection with it had never tarminated;
if tarminated it can be called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It need not be terminated, Capt. Spike, so long
as friendship exists in the human heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
“Ay, so it is always with you ladies; when a man
is bent on suthin’ closer and more interestin’ like,
<a id='you'></a>you’re for putting it off on friendship. Now friendship
is good enough in its way, Madam Budd, but
friendship isn’t <span class='it'>love</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Love!</span>” echoed the widow, fairly starting, though
she looked down at her netting, and looked as confused
as she knew how. “That is a very decided
word, Capt. Spike, and should never be mentioned
to a woman’s ear lightly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the captain now appeared to think, too, for no
sooner had he delivered himself of the important
monosyllable, than he left the widow’s side and
began to pace the deck, as it might be to moderate
his own ardor. As for Rose, she blushed, if her
more practiced aunt did not, while Harry Mulford
laughed heartily, taking good care, however, not to
be heard. The man at the wheel turned the tobacco
again, gave his trousers another hitch, and wondered
anew whither the skipper was bound. But
the drollest manifestation of surprise came from Josh,
the steward, who was passing along the lee-side of
the quarter-deck, with a teapot in his hand, when
the energetic manner of the captain sent the words
“friendship isn’t <span class='it'>love</span>” to his ears. This induced
him to stop for a single instant, and to cast a wondering
glance behind him; after which he moved on
toward the galley, mumbling as he went—“Lub!
what <span class='it'>he</span> want of lub, or what lub want of <span class='it'>him</span>!
Well, I do t’ink Capt. Spike bowse his jib out pretty
’arly dis mornin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Capt. Spike soon got over the effects of his effort,
and the confusion of the relict did not last any material
length of time. As the former had gone so
far, however, he thought the present an occasion as
good as another to bring matters to a crisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our sentiments sometimes get to be so strong,
Madam Budd,” resumed the lover, as he took his
seat again on the trunk, “that they run away with
us. Men is liable to be run away with as well as
ladies. I once had a ship run away with me, and a
pretty time we had of it. Did you ever hear of a
ship’s running away with her people, Madam Budd,
just as your horse ran away with your buggy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I must have heard of such things, sir,
my education having been so maritime, though just
at this moment I cannot recall an instance. When
my horse ran away, the buggy was cap-asided.
Did your vessel cap-aside on the occasion you
mention?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Madam Budd, no. The ship was off the
wind at the time I mean, and vessels do not capsize
when off the wind. I’ll tell you how it happened.
We was a scuddin’ under a goose-wing foresail⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” interrupted the relict eagerly. “I’ve
often heard of that sail, which is small and used only
in tempests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavy weather, Madam Budd—only in heavy
weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is amazing to me, captain, how you seamen
manage to weigh the weather. I have often heard
of light weather and heavy weather, but never
fairly understood the manner of weighing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why we <span class='it'>do</span> make out to ascertain the difference,”
replied the captain, a little puzzled for an answer,
“and I suppose it must be by means of the barometer,
which goes up and down like a pair of scales.
But the time I mean we was a scuddin’ under a
goose-wing foresail⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sail made of goose’s wings, and a beautiful
object it must be; like some of the caps and cloaks
that come from the islands, which are all of feathers,
and charming objects are they. I beg pardon—you
had your goose’s wings spread⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madam Budd, yes; we was steering for a
Mediterranean port, intending to clear a mole-head,
when a sea took us under the larboard quarter, gave
us such a sheer to-port as sent our cat-head ag’in a
spile, and raked away the chain-plates of the top-mast
back-stays, bringing down all the forrard
hamper about our ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This description produced such a confusion in the
mind of the widow that she was glad when it came
to an end. As for the captain, fearful that the
“goose’s wings” might be touched upon again, he
thought it wisest to attempt another flight on those
of Cupid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I was sayin’, Madam Budd, friendship isn’t
<span class='it'>love</span>; no, not a bit of it! Friendship is a common
sort of feelin’, but love, as you must know by exper’ence,
Madam Budd, is an uncommon sort of
feelin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fie, Capt. Spike, gentlemen should never allude
to ladies knowing any thing about love. Ladies <span class='it'>respect</span>,
and <span class='it'>admire</span>, and <span class='it'>esteem</span>, and have a <span class='it'>regard</span> for
gentlemen; but <a id='itit'></a>it is almost too strong to talk about
their love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madam Budd, yes; I dare say it <span class='it'>is</span> so, and
<span class='it'>ought</span> to be so; and I ask pardon for having said as
much as I did. But my love for your niece is of so
animated and lastin’ a natur’, that I scarce know
what I did say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capt. Spike, you amaze me! I declare I can
hardly breathe for astonishment. My niece! Surely
you do not mean Rosy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who else should I mean? My love for Miss
Rose is so very decided and animated, I tell you,
Madam Budd, that I will not answer for the consequences
should you not consent to her marryin’
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can scarce believe my ears! You, Stephen
Spike, and an old friend of her uncle’s, wishing to
marry his niece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so, Madam Budd; that’s it to a shavin’.
The regard I have for the whole family is so great,
that nothin’ less than the hand of Miss Rose in marriage
can what I call mitigate my feelin’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the relict had not one spark of tenderness
herself in behalf of Spike, while she did love Rose
better than any human being, her own self excepted.
But she had viewed all the sentiment of that morning,
and all the fine speeches of the captain, very differently
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
from what the present state of things told her
she ought to have viewed them; and she felt the
mortification natural to her situation. The captain
was so much bent on the attainment of his own
object, that he saw nothing else, and was even unconscious
that his extraordinary and somewhat loud
discourse had been overheard. Least of all did he
suspect that his admiration had been mistaken,
and that in what he called “courtin’ ” the niece, he
had been all the while “courtin’ ” the aunt. But
little apt as she was to discover any thing, Mrs.
Budd had enough of her sex’s discernment in a
matter of this sort, to perceive that she had fallen
into an awkward mistake, and enough of her sex’s
pride to resent it. Taking her work in her hand,
she left her seat and descended to the cabin with
quite as much dignity in her manner as it was in the
power of one of her height and “build” to express.
What is the most extraordinary, neither she nor
Spike ever ascertained that their whole dialogue
had been overheard. Spike continued to pace the
quarter-deck for several minutes, scarce knowing
what to think of the relict’s manner, when his attention
was suddenly drawn to other matters by the
familiar cry of “sail-ho!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was positively the first vessel with which
the Molly Swash had fallen in since she lost sight
of two or three craft that had passed her in the distance,
as she left the American coast. As usual,
this cry brought all hands on deck, and Mulford out
of his state-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been stated already that the brig was just
beginning to feel the trades, and it might have been
added, to see the mountains of San Domingo. The
winds had been variable for the last day or two, and
they still continued light, and disposed to be unsteady,
ranging from north-east to southeast, with a
preponderance in favor of the first point. At the
cry of “sail-ho!” every body looked in the indicated
direction, which was west, a little northerly, but for
a long time without success. The cry had come
from aloft, and Mulford went up as high as the fore-top
before he got any glimpse of the stranger at all.
He had slung a glass, and Spike was unusually
anxious to know the result of his examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Mulford, what do you make of her?”
he called out as soon as the mate announced that
he saw the strange vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a moment, sir, till I get a look—she’s a
long way off, and hardly visible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only see the heads of her topgallant-sails.
She seems a ship steering to the southward,
with as many kites flying as an Indiaman in the
trades. She looks as if she were carrying royal
stun’-sails, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil she does! Such a chap must not only
be in a hurry, but he must be strong handed to give
himself all this trouble in such light and var’able
winds. Are his yards square?—Is he man-of-war-ish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no telling, sir, at this distance; though
I rather think its stun’sails that I see. Go down and
get your breakfast, and in half an hour I’ll give a
better account of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was done, Mrs. Budd appearing at the table
with great dignity in her manner. Although she
had so naturally supposed that Spike’s attentions had
been intended for herself, she was rather mortified
than hurt on discovering her mistake. Her appetite,
consequently, was not impaired, though her stomach
might have been said to be very full. The meal
passed off without any scene, notwithstanding, and
Spike soon re-appeared on deck, still masticating the
last mouthful like a man in a hurry, and a good deal
<span class='it'>à l’Américaine</span>. Mulford saw his arrival, and immediately
leveled his glass again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what news now, sir?” called out the captain.
“You must have a better chance at him by
this time, for I can see the chap from off the coach-house
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir; he’s a bit nearer, certainly. I should
say that craft is a ship under stun’sails, looking to
the eastward of south, and that there are caps with
gold bands on her quarter-deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How low down can you see her?” demanded
Spike in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So emphatic and remarkable was the captain’s
manner in putting this question, that the mate cast
a look of surprise beneath him ere he answered it.
A look with the glass succeeded, when the reply
was given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir; there can be no mistake—it’s a
cruiser you may depend on it I can see the heads
of her topsails now, and they are so square and symmetrical,
that gold bands are below beyond all
doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he’s a Frenchman—Johnny Crapaud
keeps cruisers in these seas as well as the rest
on ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Johnny Crapaud’s craft don’t spread such arms,
sir. The ship is either English or American; and
he’s heading for the Mona Passage as well as
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down, sir, come down—there’s work to
be done as soon as you have breakfasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford did come down, and he was soon seated
at the table with both Josh and Jack Tier for attendants.
The aunt and the niece were in their
own cabin, a few yards distant, with the door open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a fuss ’e cap’in make ’bout dat sail,” grumbled
Josh, who had been in the brig so long that he
sometimes took liberties with even Spike himself.
“What good he t’ink t’will do to measure him inch
by inch? Bye’m by he get alongside, and den ’e
ladies even can tell all about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He nat’rally wishes to know who gets alongside,”
put in Tier, somewhat apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What matter dat. All sort of folk get alongside
of Molly Swash; and what good it do ’em. Yoh!
yoh! yoh! I <span class='it'>do</span> remem’er sich times vid ’e ole
hussy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What old hussy do you mean?” demanded Jack
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
Tier a little fiercely, and in a way to draw Mulford’s
eyes from the profile of Rose’s face to the visages of
his two attendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, gentlemen, if you please; recollect
where you are,” interrupted the mate authoritatively.
“You are not now squabbling in your galley, but
are in the cabin. What is it to you, Tier, if Josh
does call the brig an old hussy; she is old, as we
all know, and years are respectable; and as for her
being a “hussy,” that is a term of endearment
sometimes. I’ve heard the captain himself call the
Molly a “hussy” fifty times, and he loves her as he
does the apple of his eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This interference put an end to the gathering
storm as a matter of course, and the two disputants
shortly after passed on deck. No sooner was the
coast clear than Rose stood in the door of her own
cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think the strange vessel is an American?”
she asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible to say—English or American I
make no doubt. But why do you inquire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both my aunt and myself desire to quit the brig,
and if the stranger should prove to be an American
vessel of war, might not the occasion be favorable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what reason can you give for desiring to
do so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What signifies a reason,” answered Rose with
spirit “Spike is not our master, and we can come
and go as we may see fit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a reason must be given to satisfy the commander
of the vessel of war. Craft of that character
are very particular about the passengers they receive;
nor would it be altogether wise in two unprotected
females to go on board a cruiser, unless in
a case of the most obvious necessity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will not what has passed this morning be
thought a sufficient reason?” added Rose, drawing
nearer to the mate, and dropping her voice so as
not to be heard by her aunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford smiled as he gazed at the earnest but
attractive countenance of his charming companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who could tell it, or <span class='it'>how</span> could it be told?
Would the commander of a vessel of war incur the
risk of receiving such a person as yourself on board
his vessel, for the reason that the master of the craft
she was in when he fell in with her desired to
marry her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose appeared vexed, but she was at once made
sensible that it was not quite as easy to change her
vessel at sea, as to step into a strange door in a
town. She drew slowly back into her own cabin
silent and thoughtful; her aunt pursuing her netting
the whole time with an air of dignified industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Mulford, well,” called out Spike at
the head of the cabin stairs, “what news from the
coffee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready, sir,” answered the mate, exchanging
significant glances with Rose. “I shall be up in a
moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That moment soon came, and Mulford was ready
for duty. While below, Spike had caused certain
purchases to be got aloft, and the main-hatch was
open and the men collected around it, in readiness
to proceed with the work. Harry asked no questions,
for the preparations told him what was about
to be done, but passing below, he took charge of the
duty there, while the captain superintended the
part that was conducted on deck. In the course of
the next hour eight twelve-pound carronades were
sent up out of the hold, and mounted in as many of
the ports which lined the bulwarks of the brigantine.
The men seemed to be accustomed to the sort of
work in which they were now engaged, and soon
had their light batteries in order, and ready for service.
In the meantime the two vessels kept on
their respective courses, and by the time the guns
were mounted, there was a sensible difference in
their relative positions. The stranger had drawn
so near the brigantine as to be very obvious from
the latter’s deck, while the brigantine had drawn so
much nearer to the islands of San Domingo and
Porto Rico, as to render the opening between them,
the well known Mona Passage, distinctly visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all this Spike appeared to be fully aware, for
he quitted the work several times before it was
finished, in order to take a look at the stranger, and
at the land. When the batteries were arranged, he
and Mulford, each provided with a glass, gave a
few minutes to a more deliberate examination of
the first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the Mona ahead of us,” said the captain;
“of that there can be no question, and a very pretty
land-fall you’ve made of it, Harry. I’ll allow you
to be as good a navigator as floats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, sir, you have not seen fit to let
me know whither the brig is really bound this
voyage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter for that, young man—no matter, as
yet. All in good time. When I tell you to lay
your course for the Mona, you can lay your course
for the Mona; and, as soon as we are through the
passage, I’ll let you know what is wanted next—if
that bloody chap, who is nearing us, will let
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why should any vessel wish to molest us
on our passage, Capt. Spike?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sure enough! It’s war-times, you know,
and war-times always bring trouble to the trader—though
it sometimes brings profit, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Spike concluded, he gave his mate a knowing
wink, which the other understood to mean that he
expected himself some of the unusual profit to which
he alluded. Mulford did not relish this secret communication,
for the past had induced him to suspect
the character of the trade in which his commander
was accustomed to engage. Without making any
sort of reply, or encouraging the confidence by even
a smile, he leveled his glass at the stranger, as did
Spike, the instant he ceased to grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s one of Uncle Sam’s fellows!” exclaimed
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
the captain, dropping the glass. “I’d swear to the
chap in any admiralty court on ’arth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Tis a vessel of war, out of all doubt,” returned
the mate, “and under a cloud of canvas. I can
make out the heads of her courses now, and see
that she is carrying hard, for a craft that is almost
close-hauled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay; no merchantman keeps his light stun’-sails
set, as near the wind as that fellow’s going.
He’s a big chap, too—a frigate, at least, by his
canvas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, sir—they build such heavy corvettes
nowadays, that I should rather take her for
one of them. They tell me ships are now sent to
sea which mount only two-and-twenty guns, but
which measure quite a thousand tons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With thunderin’ batteries, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With short thirty-twos and a few rapping sixty-eight
Paixhans—or Columbiads, as they ought in
justice to be called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think this chap likely to be a craft of
that sort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing is more probable, sir. Government has
several, and, since this war has commenced, it has
been sending off cruiser after cruiser into the Gulf.
The Mexicans dare not send a vessel of war to
sea, which would be sending them to Norfolk, or
New York, at once; but no one can say when they
may begin to make a prey of our commerce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have taken nothing as yet, Mr. Mulford,
and, to tell you the truth, I’d much rather fall in
with one of Don Montezuma’s craft than one of
Uncle Sam’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a singular taste, for an American, Capt.
Spike, unless you think, now our guns are mounted,
we can handle a Mexican,” returned Mulford coldly.
“At all events, it is some answer to those who ask
‘What is the navy about?’ that months of war have
gone by, and not an American has been captured.
Take away that navy, and the insurance offices in
Wall street would tumble like a New York party-wall
in a fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, I’d rather take my chance, just
now, with Don Montezuma than with Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford did not reply, though the earnest manner
in which Spike expressed himself helped to increase
his distrust touching the nature of the voyage.
With <span class='it'>him</span> the captain had no further conference,
but it was different as respects the boatswain. That
worthy was called aft, and for half an hour he and
Spike were conversing apart, keeping their eyes
fastened on the strange vessel most of the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was noon before all uncertainty touching the
character of the stranger ceased. By that time,
however, both vessels were entering the Mona Passage;
the brig well to windward, on the Porto
Rico side; while the ship was so far to leeward
as to be compelled to keep every thing close-hauled,
in order to weather the island. The hull of the last
could now be seen, and no doubt was entertained
about her being a cruiser, and one of some size, too.
Spike thought she was a frigate; but Mulford still
inclined to the opinion that she was one of the new
ships; perhaps a real corvette, or with a light spar-deck
over her batteries. Two or three of the new
vessels were known to be thus fitted, and this
might be one. At length all doubt on the subject
ceased, the stranger setting an American ensign,
and getting so near as to make it apparent that she
had but a single line of guns. Still she was a large
ship, and the manner that she ploughed through the
brine, close-hauled as she was, extorted admiration
even from Spike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better begin to shorten sail, Mr. Mulford,”
the captain at length most reluctantly remarked.
“We might give the chap the slip, perhaps,
by keeping close in under Porto Rico, but
he would give us a long chase, and might drive
us away to windward, when I wish to keep off between
Cuba and Jamaica. He’s a traveler; look,
how he stands up to it under that cloud of canvas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulford was slow to commence on the studding-sails,
and the cruiser was getting nearer and nearer.
At length a gun was fired, and a heavy shot fell
about two hundred yards short of the brig, and a
little out of line with her. On this hint, Spike
turned the hands up, and began to shorten sail. In
ten minutes the Swash was under her topsail, mainsail
and jib, with her light sails hanging in the gear,
and all the steering canvas in. In ten minutes
more the cruiser was so near as to admit of the
faces of the three or four men whose heads were
above the hammock-cloths being visible, when she
too began to fold her wings. In went <span class='it'>her</span> royals,
topgallant-sails, and various kites, as it might be by
some common muscular agency; and up went her
courses. Every thing was done at once. By this
time she was crossing the brig’s wake, looking exceedingly
beautiful, with her topsails lifting, her light
sails blowing out, and even her heavy courses fluttering
in the breeze. There flew the glorious stars
and stripes also; of brief existence, but full of recollections!
The moment she had room her helm went
up, her bows fell off, and down she came, on
the weather quarter of the Swash, so near as to
render a trumpet nearly useless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On board the brig everybody was on deck; even
the relict having forgotten her mortification in
curiosity. On board the cruiser no one was visible,
with the exception of a few men in each top, and a
group of gold-banded caps on the poop. Among these
officers stood the captain, a red-faced, middle-aged
man, with the usual signs of his rank about him;
and at his side was his lynx-eyed first lieutenant.
The surgeon and purser were also there, though
they stood a little apart from the more nautical dignitaries.
The hail that followed came out of a
trumpet that was thrust through the mizzen-rigging;
the officer who used it taking his cue from the poop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brig is that?” commenced the discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Molly Swash, of New York, Stephen Spike,
master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
“Where from, and whither bound?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From New York, and bound to Key West and a
market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pause succeeded this answer, during which the
officers on the poop of the cruiser held some discourse
with him of the trumpet. During the interval
the cruiser ranged fairly up abeam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are well to windward of your port, sir,” observed
he of the trumpet significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it; but it’s war-times, and I didn’t know
but there might be piccaroons hovering about the
Havanna.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The coast is clear, and our cruisers will keep it
so. I see you have a battery, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay; some old guns that I’ve had aboard these
ten years; they’re useful, sometimes, in these seas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true. I’ll range ahead of you, and as soon
as you’ve room, I’ll thank you to heave-to. I wish
to send a boat on board you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike was sullen enough on receiving this order,
but there was no help for it. He was now in the
jaws of the lion, and his wisest course was to submit
to the penalties of his position with the best
grace he could. The necessary orders were consequently
given, and the brig no sooner got room
than she came by the wind and backed her topsail.
The cruiser went about, and, passing to windward,
backed her main-topsail just forward of the Swash’s
beam. Then the latter lowered a boat, and sent it,
with a lieutenant and a midshipman in its stern-sheets,
on board the brigantine. As the cutter approached,
Spike went to the gangway to receive
the strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although there will be frequent occasion to mention
this cruiser, the circumstances are of so recent
occurrence, that we do not choose to give either
her name, or that of any one belonging to her. We
shall, consequently, tell the curious, who may be
disposed to turn to their navy-lists and blue-books,
that the search will be of no use, as all the names
we shall use, in reference to this cruiser, will be
fictitious. As much of the rest of our story as the
reader please may be taken for gospel; but we tell
him frankly, that we have thought it most expedient
to adopt assumed names, in connection with this
vessel and all her officers. There are good reasons
for so doing; and, among others, is that of abstaining
from arming a <span class='it'>clique</span> to calumniate her commander,
(who, by the way, like another commander
in the Gulf that might be named, and who has actually
been exposed to the sort of <span class='it'>tracasserie</span> to which
there is allusion, is one of the very ablest men in
the service,) in order to put another in his place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer who now came over the side of the
Swash we shall call Wallace; he was the second
lieutenant of the vessel of war. He was about
thirty, and the midshipman who followed him was
a well grown lad of nineteen. Both had a decided
man-of-war look, and both looked a little curiously
at the vessel that they had boarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your servant, sir,” said Wallace, touching his
cap in reply to Spike’s somewhat awkward bow.
“Your brig is the Molly Swash, Stephen Spike,
bound from New York to Key West and a market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got it all as straight, lieutenant, as if you
was a readin’ it from the log.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next thing, sir, is to know of what your
cargo is composed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flour; eight hundred barrels of flour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flour! Would you not do better to carry that
to Liverpool? The Mississippi must be almost
turned into paste by the quantity of flour it floats to
market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Notwithstanding that, lieutenant, I know Uncle
Sam’s economy so well, as to believe I shall part
with every barrel of my flour to his contractors, at
a handsome profit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You read whig newspapers principally, I rather
think, Mr. Spike,” answered Wallace, in his cool,
deliberate way, smiling, however, as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We may just as well say here, that nature intended
this gentleman for a second lieutenant, the
very place he filled. He was a capital second
lieutenant, while he would not have earned his
rations as first. So well was he assured of this
peculiarity in his moral composition, that he did
not wish to be the first lieutenant of any thing in
which he sailed. A respectable seaman, a well-read
and intelligent man, a capital deck officer, or
watch officer, he was too indolent to desire to be
any thing more, and was as happy as the day was
long, in the easy berth he filled. The first lieutenant
had been his messmate as a midshipman, and ranked
him but two on the list, in his present commission;
but he did not envy him in the least. On the contrary,
one of his greatest pleasures was to get
“Working Willy,” as he called his senior, over a
glass of wine, or a tumbler of “hot stuff,” and make
him recount the labors of the day. On such occasions,
Wallace never failed to compare the situation
of “Working Willy” with his own gentlemanlike
ease and independence. As second lieutenant, his
rank raised him above most of the unpleasant duty
of the ship, while it did not raise him high enough
to plunge him into the never-ending labors of his
senior. He delighted to call himself the “ship’s
gentleman,” a <span class='it'>sobriquet</span> he well deserved, on more
accounts than one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You read Whig newspapers principally, I rather
think, Mr. Spike,” answered the lieutenant, as has
been just mentioned, “while we on board the
Poughkeepsie indulge in looking over the columns
of the Union, as well as over those of the Intelligencer,
when by good luck we can lay our hands
on a stray number.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ship, then, is called the Poughkeepsie, is
she, sir?” inquired Spike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is her name, thanks to a most benificent
and sage provision of Congress, which has extended
its parental care over the navy so far as to imagine
that a man chosen by the people to exercise so
many of the functions of a sovereign, is not fit to
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
name a ship. All our two and three deckers are
to be called after states; the frigates after rivers;
and the sloops after towns. Thus it is that our craft
has the honor to be called the United States ship
the ”Poughkeepsie,“ instead of the “Arrow,” or
the “Wasp,” or the “Curlew,” or the “Petrel,” as
might otherwise have been the case. But the
wisdom of Congress is manifest, for the plan teaches
us sailors geography.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, yes, one can pick up a bit of l’arnin’ in
that way cheap. The Poughkeepsie, Capt.—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The United States’ ship Poughkeepsie, 20, Capt.
Adam Mull, at your service. But, Mr. Spike, you
will allow me to look at your papers. It is a duty
I like, for it can be performed quietly, and without
any fuss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike looked distrustfully at his new acquaintance,
but went for his vessel’s papers without any
very apparent hesitation. Every thing was <span class='it'>en <a id='regle'></a>règle</span>,
and Wallace soon got through with the clearance,
manifest, &amp;c. Indeed the cargo, on paper at least,
was of the simplest and least complicated character,
being composed of nothing but eight hundred barrels
of flour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all looks very well on paper, Mr. Spike,”
added the boarding officer. “With your permission,
we will next see how it looks in sober reality. I
perceive your main hatch is open, and I suppose it
will be no difficult matter just to take a glance at
your hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a ladder, sir, that will take us at once to
the half-deck, for I have no proper ’twixt decks in
this craft; she’s too small for that sort of out-fit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter, she has a hold, I suppose, and that
can contain cargo. Take me to it by the shortest
road, Mr. Spike, for I am no great admirer of
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike now led the way below, Wallace following,
leaving the midshipman on deck, who had fallen into
conversation with the relict and her pretty niece.
The half deck of the brigantine contained spare sails,
provisions, and water, as usual, while quantities of
old canvas lay scattered over the cargo; more
especially in the wake of the hatches, of which
there were two besides that which led from the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flour to the number of eight hundred barrels,”
said Wallace, striking his foot against a barrel that
lay within his reach. “The cargo is somewhat singular
to come from New York, going to Key West,
my dear Spike?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you know what sort of a place Key
West is, sir; a bit of an island in which there is
scarce so much as a potatoe grows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir; I know Key West very well, having
been in and out a dozen times. All eatables are
imported, turtle excepted. But flour can be brought
down the Mississippi so much cheaper than it can
be brought from New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any idee, lieutenant, what Uncle
Sam’s men are paying for it at <span class='it'>New Orleens</span>, just
to keep soul and bodies together among the
so’gers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be true, sir—quite true, I dare say,
Mr. Spike. Haven’t you a bit of a chair that a
fellow can sit down on—this half-deck of <a id='yours2'></a>yours is
none of the most comfortable places to stand in.
Thank you, sir—thank you with all my heart.
What lots of old sails you have scattered about the
hold, especially in the wake of the hatches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the craft being little more than in good
ballast trim, I keep the hatches off to air her; and
the spray might spit down upon the flour at odd
times but for them ’ere sails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, a prudent caution. So you think Uncle
Sam’s people will be after this flour as soon as they
learn you have got it snug in at Key West?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What more likely, sir? You know how it is
with our government—always wrong, whatever it
does! and I can show you paragraphs in letters
written from <span class='it'>New Orleens</span>, which tell us that Uncle
Sam is paying 75 and 80 per cent. more for flour
than any body else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be a flush old chap to be able to do
that, Spike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flush! I rather think he is. Do you know that
he is spendin’, accordin’ to approved accounts, at
this blessed moment, as much as half a million a
day. I own a wish to be pickin’ up some of the
coppers while they are scattered about so plentifully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a million a day! why that is only at the
rate of $187,000,000 per annum; a mere trifle, Spike,
that is scarce worth mentioning among us mariners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so in the newspapers, I can swear, lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, and the newspapers will swear to it, too,
and they that gave the newspapers their cue. But
no matter, our business is with this flour. Will you
sell us a barrel or two for our mess? I heard the
caterer say we should want flour in the course of a
week or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike seemed embarrassed, though not to a
degree to awaken suspicion in his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never sold cargo at sea, long as I’ve sailed and
owned a craft,” he answered as if uncertain what to
do. “If you’ll pay the price I expect to get in the
Gulf, and will take <span class='it'>ten</span> barrels, I don’t know but we
may make a trade on’t. I shall only ask expected
prices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which will be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten dollars a barrel. For one hundred silver
dollars I will put into your boat ten barrels of the
very best brand known in the western country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is dealing rather more extensively than I
anticipated, but we will reflect on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace now indolently arose and ascended to the
quarter-deck followed by Spike, who continued to
press the flour on him, as if anxious to make money.
But the lieutenant hesitated about paying a price as
high as ten dollars, or to take a quantity as large as
ten barrels.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
“Our mess is no great matter after all,” he said
carelessly. “Four lieutenants, the purser, two doctors,
the master, and a marine officer, and you get
us all. Nine men could never eat ten barrels of
flour, my dear Spike, you will see for yourself, with
the quantity of excellent bread we carry. You
forget the bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it, Mr. Wallace, since that is your
name. But such flour as this of mine has not been
seen in the Gulf this many a day. I ought in reason
to ask twelve dollars for it, and insist on such a ship
as your’n’s taking twenty instead of the ten barrels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, sir, the ten will more than suffice;
unless, indeed, the captain wants some for the
cabin. How is it with your steerage messes, Mr.
Archer—do <span class='it'>you</span> want any flour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We draw a little from the ship, according to rule,
sir, but we can’t go as many puddings latterly as
we could before we touched last at the Havanna,”
answered the laughing midshipman. “There isn’t
a fellow among us, sir, that could pay a shore-boat
for landing him, should we go in again before the
end of another month. I never knew such a place
as Havanna. They say midshipmen’s money melts
there twice as soon as lieutenants’ money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s clear, then, <span class='it'>you’ll</span> not take any of the ten.
I am afraid after all, Mr. Spike, we cannot trade,
unless you will consent to let me have two barrels.
I’ll venture on two at ten dollars, high as the
price is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t forgive myself in six months for
making so bad a bargain, lieutenant, so we’ll say no
more about it if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a lady that wishes to say a word to you,
Mr. Wallace, before we go back to the ship, if you
are at leisure to hear her, or <span class='it'>them</span> for there are
two of them,” put in Archer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment Mrs. Budd was approaching with
a dignified step, while Rose followed timidly a little
in the rear. Wallace was a good deal surprised
at this application, and Spike was quite as much
provoked. As for Mulford, he watched the interview
from a distance, a great deal more interested
in its result than he cared to have known, more
especially to his commanding officer. Its object
was to get a passage in the vessel of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an officer of that Uncle Sam vessel,”
commenced Mrs. Budd, who thought that she would
so much the more command the respect and attention
of her listener, by showing him early how
familiar she was with even the slang dialect of
the seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the honor, ma’am, to belong to that Uncle
Sam craft,” answered Wallace gravely, though he
bowed politely at the same time, looking intently at
the beautiful girl in the back-ground as he so did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I’ve been told, sir. She’s a beautiful vessel,
lieutenant, and is full jiggered I perceive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time in his life, or at least for the
first time since his first cruise, Wallace wore a
mystified look, being absolutely at a loss to imagine
what “full jiggered” could mean. He only looked
therefore, for he did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Budd means that you’ve a full <span class='it'>rigged</span>
craft,” put in Spike, anxious to have a voice in the
conference, “this vessel being only a <span class='it'>half</span>-rigged
brig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! ay; yes, yes—the lady is quite right. We
are full jiggered from our dead-eyes to our eye-bolts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought as much, sir, from your ground hamper
and top-tackles,” added the relict smiling. “For my
part there is nothing in nature that I so much admire
as a full jiggered ship, with her canvas out of
the bolt-ropes, and her clew-lines and clew-garnets
braced sharp, and her yards all abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am, it is just as you say, a very charming
spectacle. Our baby was born full grown, and
with all her hamper aloft just as you see her. Some
persons refer vessels to art, but I think you are quite
right in referring them to nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing <span class='it'>can</span> be more natural to me, lieutenant,
than a fine ship standing on her canvas. It’s an
object to improve the heart and to soften the <a id='under'></a>understanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I should think, ma’am,” returned Wallace,
a little quizzically, “judging from the effect on
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech, unfortunately timed as it was,
wrought a complete change in Rose’s feelings, and
she no longer wished to exchange the Swash for
the Poughkeepsie. She saw that her aunt was
laughed at in secret, and that was a circumstance
that never failed to grate on every nerve in her
system. She had been prepared to second and sustain
the intended application—she was now determined
to oppose it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” resumed the unconscious relict, “and
to soften the understanding. Lieutenant, did you
ever cross the Capricorn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No less than six times; three going and three
returning, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did Neptune come on board you, and were
you shaved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every thing was done <span class='it'>secundum artem</span>, ma’am.
The razor was quite an example of what are called
in poetry ‘thoughts too deep for tears.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must have been delightful. As for me,
I’m quite a devotee of Neptune’s; but I’m losing
time, for no doubt your ship is all ready to pull away
and carry on sail⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt, may I say a word to you before you go
any further,” put in Rose in her quiet but very controlling
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aunt complied, and Wallace, as soon as left
alone, felt like a man who was released from a
quick-sand, into which every effort to extricate himself
only plunged him so much the deeper. At this
moment the ship hailed, and the lieutenant took a
hasty leave of Spike, motioned to the midshipman
to precede him, and followed the latter into his boat.
Spike saw his visiter off in person, tending the side
and offering the man-ropes with his own hands.
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
For this civility Wallace thanked him, calling out as
his boat pulled from the brig’s side—“If we ‘<span class='it'>pull</span>
away,’ ” accenting the “pull” in secret derision of
the relict’s mistake, “<span class='it'>you</span> can <span class='it'>pull</span> away; our filling
the topsail being a sign for you to do the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you go, and joy go with you,” muttered
Spike, as he descended from the gangway. “A
pretty kettle of fish would there have been cooked
had I let him have his two barrels of flour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man-of-war’s cutter was soon under the lee
of the ship, where it discharged its freight, when it
was immediately run up. During the whole time
Wallace had been absent, Capt. Mull and his officers
remained on the poop, principally occupied in examining
and discussing the merits of the Swash.
No sooner had their officer returned, however, than
an order was given to fill away, it being supposed
that the Poughkeepsie had no further concern with
the brigantine. As for Wallace, he ascended to the
poop and made the customary report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a queer cargo to be carrying to Key West
from the Atlantic coast,” observed the captain in a
deliberating sort of manner, as if the circumstance
excited suspicion; “Yet the Mexicans can hardly
be in want of any such supplies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you <span class='it'>see</span> the flour, Wallace?” inquired the
first lieutenant, who was well aware of his messmate’s
indolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, and <span class='it'>felt it</span> too. The lower hold of the
brig is full of flour, and of nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ware round, sir—ware round and pass athwart
the brig’s wake,” interrupted the captain. “There’s
plenty of room now, and I wish to pass as near that
craft as we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This manœuvre was executed. The sloop-of-war
no sooner filled her maintop-sail than she drew
ahead, leaving plenty of room for the brigantine to
make sail on her course. Spike did not profit by
this opening, however, but he sent several men
aloft forward, where they appeared to be getting
ready to send down the upper yards and the topgallant-mast.
No sooner was the sloop-of-war’s
helm put up than that vessel passed close along the
brigantine’s weather side, and kept off across her
stern on her course. As she did this the canvas
was fluttering aboard her, in the process of making
sail, and Mull held a short discourse with Spike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is any thing the matter aloft?” demanded the
man-of-war’s man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay; I’ve sprung my topgallant-mast, and
think this a good occasion to get another up in <a id='its'></a>its
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I lend you a carpenter or two, Mr. Spike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank’ee, sir, thank’ee with all my heart; but
we can do without them. It’s an old stick, and it’s
high time a better stood where it does. Who knows
but I may be chased and feel the want of reliable
spars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Mull smiled and raised his cap in the way
of an adieu, when the conversation ended, the
Poughkeepsie sliding off rapidly with a free wind,
leaving the Swash nearly stationary. In ten minutes
the two vessels were more than a mile apart; in
twenty beyond the reach of shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the natural and common-place
manner in which this separation took place, there
was much distrust on board each vessel, and a good
deal of consummate management on the part of
Spike. The latter knew that every foot the sloop-of-war
went on her course, carried her just so far to
leeward, placing his own brig, in-so-much, dead to
windward of her. As the Swash’s best point of
sailing, relatively considered, was close hauled, this
was giving to Spike a great security against any
change of purpose on the part of the vessel of war.
Although his people were aloft and actually sent
down the topgallant-mast, it was only to send it up
again, the spar being of admirable toughness, and as
sound as the day it was cut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think, Mr. Mulford,” said the captain
sarcastically, “that Uncle Sam’s glasses are good
enough to tell the difference in wood at two league’s
distance, so we’ll trust to the old stick a little
longer. Ay, ay, let ’em run off before it, we’ll find
another road by which to reach our port.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sloop-of-war is going round the south side
of Cuba, Capt. Spike,” answered the mate, “and I
have understood you to say that you intended to
go by the same passage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A body may change his mind, and no murder.
Only consider, Harry, how common it is for folks to
change their minds. I <span class='it'>did</span> intend to pass between
Cuba and Jamaica, but I intend it no longer. Our
run from Montauk has been oncommon short, and
I’ve time enough to spare to go to the southward of
Jamaica too, if the notion takes me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would greatly prolong the passage, Capt.
Spike—a week at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if it does—I’ve a week to spare; we’re
nine days afore our time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our time for what, sir? Is there any particular
time set for a vessel’s going into Key West?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be womanish and over cur’ous, Mulford.
I sail with sealed orders, and when we get well to
windward of Jamaica, ’twill be time enough to open
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike was as good as his word. As soon as he
thought the sloop-of war was far enough to leeward,
or when she was hull down, he filled away and made
sail on the wind to get nearer to Porto Rico. Long
ere it was dark he had lost sight of the sloop-of-war,
when he altered his course to south, westerly, which
was carrying him in the direction he named, or to
windward of Jamaica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this artifice was being practiced on board
the Molly Swash, the officers of the Poughkeepsie
were not quite satisfied with their own mode of
proceeding with the brigantine. The more they
reasoned on the matter the more unlikely it seemed
to them that Spike could be really carrying a cargo
of flour from New York to Key West, in the expectation
of disposing of it to the United States’ contractors,
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
and the more out of the way did he seem
to be in running through the Mona Passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His true course should have been by the Hole
in the Wall, and so down along the north side of
Cuba, before the wind,” observed the first lieutenant.
“I wonder that never struck you, Wallace; you
who so little like trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly I knew it, but we lazy people like
running off before the wind, and I did not know but
such were Mr. Spike’s tastes,” answered the “ship’s
gentleman.” “In my judgment, the reluctance he
showed to letting us have any of his flour, is much
the most suspicious circumstance in the whole
affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two speeches were made on the poop, in
the presence of the captain, but in a sort of an aside
that admitted of some of the wardroom familiarity
exhibited. Capt. Mull was not supposed to hear
what passed, though hear it he in fact did, as was
seen by his own remarks, which immediately succeeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understood you to say, Mr. Wallace,” observed
the captain, a little drily, “that you <span class='it'>saw</span> the flour
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw the flour-<span class='it'>barrels</span>, sir; and as regularly
built were they as any barrels that ever were
branded. But a flour-barrel <span class='it'>may</span> have contained
something beside <span class='it'>flour</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flour usually makes itself visible in the handling;
were these barrels quite clean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far from it, sir. They showed flour on their
staves, like any other cargo. After all, the man
may have more sense than we give him credit for,
and find a high market for his cargo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Capt. Mull seemed to muse, which was a hint
for his juniors not to continue the conversation, but
rather to seem to muse, too. After a short pause,
the captain quietly remarked—“Well, gentlemen,
he will be coming down after us, I suppose, as soon
as he gets his new topgallant-mast on-end, and then
we can keep a bright look out for him. We shall
cruise off Cape St. Antonio, for a day or two, and no
doubt shall get another look at him. I should like
to have one baking from his flour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Spike had no intention to give the Poughkeepsie
the desired opportunity. As has been
stated, he stood off to the southward on a wind, and
completely doubled the eastern end of Jamaica,
when he put his helm up, and went, with favoring
wind and current, toward the northward and westward.
The consequence was, that he did not fall
in with the Poughkeepsie at all, which vessel was
keeping a sharp look out for him in the neighborhood
of Cape St. Antonio and the Isle of Pines, at
the very moment he was running down the coast
of Yucatan. Of all the large maritime countries of
the world, Mexico, on the Atlantic, is that which is
the most easily blockaded, by a superior naval power.
By maintaining a proper force between Key West
and the Havanna, and another squadron between
Cape St. Antonio and Loggerhead Key, the whole
country, the Bay of Honduras excepted, is shut up,
as it might be in a band-box. It is true the Gulf
would be left open to the Mexicans, were not squadrons
kept nearer in; but, as for any thing getting
out into the broad Atlantic, it would be next to
hopeless. The distance to be watched between the
Havanna and Key West is only about sixty miles,
while that in the other direction is not much greater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the Swash was making the circuit of Jamaica,
as described, her captain had little communication
with his passengers. The misunderstanding
with the relict embarrassed him as much as it
embarrassed her; and he was quite willing to let
time mitigate her resentment. Rose would be just
as much in his power a fortnight hence as she was
to-day. This cessation in the captain’s attentions
gave the females greater liberty, and they improved
it, singularly enough as it seemed to Mulford, by
cultivating a strange sort of intimacy with Jack
Tier. The very day that succeeded the delicate
conversation with Mrs. Budd, to a part of which
Jack had been an auditor, the uncouth-looking
steward’s assistant was seen in close conference
with the pretty Rose; the subject of their conversation
being, apparently, of a most engrossing nature.
From that hour, Jack got to be not only a confidant,
but a favorite, to Mulford’s great surprise. A less
inviting subject for <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> and confidential dialogues,
thought the young man, could not well exist;
but so it was; woman’s caprices are inexplicable;
and not only Rose and her aunt, but even the captious
and somewhat distrustful Biddy, manifested on
all occasions not only friendship, but kindness and
consideration, for Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You quite put my nose out o’ joint, you Jack
Tier, with ’e lady,” grumbled Josh, the steward <span class='it'>de
jure</span>, if not now <span class='it'>de facto</span>, of the craft, “and I never
see nuttin’ like it! I s’pose you expect ten dollar,
at least, from dem passenger, when we gets in. But
I’d have you to know, Misser Jack, if you please,
dat a steward be a steward, and he don’t like to
hab trick played wid him, afore he own face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poh! poh! Joshua,” answered Jack good naturedly,
“don’t distress yourself on a consait. In
the first place, you’ve got no nose to be put out of
joint; or, if you have really a nose, it has no joint.
It’s nat’ral for folks to like their own color, and the
ladies prefer me, because I’m white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No so werry white as all dat, nudder,” grumbled
Josh. “I see great many whiter dan you. But, if
dem lady like you so much as to gib you ten dollar,
as I expects, when we gets in, I presumes you’ll
hand over half, or six dollar, of dat money to your
superior officer, as is law in de case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you call six the half of ten, Joshua, my scholar,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, den, seven, if you like dat better. I wants
just half and just half I means to get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And half you shall have, maty. I only wish you
would just tell me where we shall be, when we
gets in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
“How I know, white man? Dat belong to skipper,
and better ask him. If he don’t gib you lick in de
chop, p’rhaps he tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jack Tier had no taste for “licks in the chops,”
he did not follow Josh’s advice. But his agreeing
to give half of the ten dollars to the steward kept
peace in the cabins. He was even so scrupulous of
his word, as to hand to Josh a half eagle that very
day; money he had received from Rose; saying he
would trust to Providence for his own half of the
expected <span class='it'>douceur</span>. This concession placed Jack
Tier on high grounds with his “superior officer,”
and from that time the former was left to do the
whole of the customary service of the ladies’ cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As respects the vessel, nothing worthy of notice
occurred until she had passed Loggerhead Key,
and was fairly launched in the Gulf of Mexico.
Then, indeed, Spike took a step that greatly surprised
his mate. The latter was directed to bring
all his instruments, charts, &amp;c., and place them in
the captain’s state-room, where it was understood
they were to remain until the brig got into port.
Spike was but an indifferent navigator, while Mulford
was one of a higher order than common. So
much had the former been accustomed to rely on
the latter, indeed, as they approached a strange
coast, that he could not possibly have taken any
step, that was not positively criminal, which would
have given his mate more uneasiness than this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, Mulford naturally enough suspected that
Spike intended to push for some Mexican port, by
thus blinding his eyes as to the position of the vessel.
The direction steered, however, soon relieved
the mate from this apprehension. From the eastern
extremity of Yucatan, the Mexican coast trends to
the westward, and even to the south of west, for a
long distance, whereas the course steered by Spike
was north, easterly. This was diverging from the
enemy’s coast instead of approaching it, and the
circumstance greatly relieved the apprehensions of
Mulford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was the sequestration of the mate’s instruments
the only suspicious act of Spike. He caused
the brig’s paint to be entirely altered, and even went
so far toward disguising her, as to make some
changes aloft. All this was done as the vessel
passed swiftly on her course, and every thing had
been effected, apparently to the captain’s satisfaction,
when the cry of “land-ho!” was once more
heard. The land proved to be a cluster of low,
small islands, part coral, part sand, that might have
been eight or ten in number, and the largest of
which did not possess a surface of more than a very
few acres. Many were the merest islets imaginable,
and on one of the largest of the cluster rose a tall,
gaunt light-house, having the customary dwelling
of its keeper at its base. Nothing else was visible;
the broad expanse of the blue waters of the Gulf
excepted. All the land in sight would not probably
have made one field of twenty acres in extent, and
that seemed cut off from the rest of the world, by a
broad barrier of water. It was a spot of such singular
situation and accessories, that Mulford gazed
at it with a burning desire to know where he was,
as the brig steered through a channel between two
of the islets, into a capacious and perfectly safe
basin, formed by the group, and dropped her anchor
in its centre.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lucy, is that you? I was just wishing for
you,” exclaimed Emily Sutherland to her sister,
Mrs. Coolidge. “We are busy discussing our dresses
for the Fancy Ball. What character do you mean to
take? Have you decided on your dress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have not, Emily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s high time to begin to think about it.
Every milliner and <a id='man'></a>mantua-maker in town will be
full of work soon. I told Madame Dudevant yesterday
she must consider herself engaged to make
my dress by the 22d. You had better bespeak her,
too, or you will find yourself too late if you put it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall wear something so simple it’s not worth
while having it made by her,” replied Mrs. Coolidge.
“I shall go as the ‘White Lady,’ or⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the ‘White Lady;’ for Heaven’s sake,” interrupted
Emily, “that’s so hackneyed. Every
body who can muster an old book-muslin, and a
few yards of tulle, goes as the ‘White Lady.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a novice, or a Druid priestess,” continued
Mrs. Coolidge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just as bad,” pursued her sister impatiently.
“No, no, you and Tom must go in
character together; you as Titania, and he as Bully
Bottom. You are so light, and slight, and fair, you
will look Titania very well; and Tom will make a
grand Bully—so full of fun and humor. You would
contrast beautifully. You must hang upon his arm,
and ‘stick musk roses in his sleek smooth head,
and <span class='it'>pinch</span> his large, fair ears,’ for it’ll hardly do to
‘kiss’ them, and call him ‘your gentle joy.’ I am
sure you could do that to the life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Coolidge smiled, for the idea caught her
fancy; but then she looked graver as she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But those would be expensive dresses, Emily.
I merely meant to wear something that would entitle
me to an entrance. If the invitations did not say
‘<span class='it'>costume de rigueur</span>,’ I should not think of a fancy
dress at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what nonsense,” said Emily. “The expense
is not much; I am sure Tom would not mind it.
I’ll speak to him about it,” she continued; for she had
been so accustomed to hear her father scold at expense,
that she concluded, of course, her sister’s
objections must now have reference to her husband,
and that consequently if she spoke first to him, she
was doing Lucy a great service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, pray don’t put it in his head,” said the young
wife eagerly, “for I fear he would be so taken by the
idea, he would not stop to count the cost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” said Emily, opening her eyes very
wide, “why need you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, Emily, as we are young people just
beginning, I think we ought to⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be patterns,” said Emily. “Well and good,
my dear, only don’t begin until after this ball, if you
please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to set up as a pattern,” said Lucy,
“but still I would not wish to do any thing extravagant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no great extravagance in these dresses,
I am sure,” replied Emily. “That’s one reason I
selected them for you and Tom; and then I thought
you would like to go in character together. I really
flattered myself I had hit sentiment and economy
with one stone beautifully. But you make as long
a face about it as if I had proposed King Solomon
and the Queen of Sheba to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should Titania’s dress be?” inquired Mrs.
Coolidge thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, something very light. Tulle, trimmed with
a little silver—nothing is cheaper than that, you
know,” answered Emily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it is only for one night,” pursued Lucy, “I
would not feel authorized to go to much expense.
If it were a dress that could ever be worn again⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never can, or never ought at least, wear
any tulle dress over twice; and therefore it does
not make much difference about its being made in
costume,” said Emily carelessly. “Tom’s dress,
you know, is the simplest thing in the world. It’s
only a weaver’s apron, &amp;c. The ass’s head he can
easily have made; he’ll get it for a trifle at any
toy-store, I should think. Ah, there’s Tom,” cried
Emily, as she saw her brother-in-law entering the
hall. “Here, Mr. Coolidge, come here,” she called.
“Come in and persuade this perverse wife of yours
into being reasonable. Here I’ve been ransacking
my head for suitable characters for her and you for
the Fancy Ball; and just as I had hit upon the very
thing for both of you, and expecting your joint vote
of thanks, and compliments for the brilliancy of my
idea, she puts on a grave face, and makes all sorts
of objections. Don’t you think she would make a
pretty Titania, and you a beautiful, broad-shouldered
Bully Bottom? I’ll tell you what, you shall not be
lost to the world as Bully; if <span class='it'>she</span> wont be your
Titania, <span class='it'>I</span> will, though I don’t think I will look the
character very well, and beside⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why Lucy,” said her husband, “I don’t think
you could possibly find any thing prettier; and really,
Emily, I will give you my vote of thanks at once for
my share of it. Bully always was a favorite of mine.
You see I am more grateful than Lucy. However,”
continued he, turning to his wife, “If you don’t like
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
it, ‘I am agreeable,’ as country people say, to any
thing you prefer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing else that I prefer,” she replied,
“only I thought the <span class='it'>Dame Blanche</span> would be more
economical.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I veto the <span class='it'>Dame Blanche</span>,” cried Emily before
Coolidge had time to speak. “It’s just one of those
things that are very pretty the first time; but it’s as
old and common now as possible. Besides, as you
are a bride, Lucy, people will expect something
from you; you always have dressed well as Lucy
Sutherland⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be sorry if Lucy Coolidge appeared to
less advantage now,” said Coolidge, taking Emily’s
hint, and a little piqued by the insinuation. “I
think, my dear, that would not be paying me much
of a compliment,” he added good-naturedly, for he
was the best tempered person in the world. “Come,
if you like the dress, make up your mind at once.
And, Emily, as you are it seems grand costumer-general
on the occasion, perhaps you will be so kind
as to lend me your aid afterward. Will you go
with me when I look for some <span class='it'>artiste</span> capable of
executing Bully’s head and ears?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure, as soon as I finish with your lady
wife here. Now for Titania, Lucy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a white satin dress, Emily, that I think
would do for the under petticoat,” said Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White satin,” said Emily musingly. “No, that
wont do—it should be silk. Besides you’ve worn
your satin, and the first thing in these dresses, and
indeed in every other, is that they should be fresh
and clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” said Mr. Coolidge. “I don’t understand
much of lady’s dress, but that much I do.
Nothing I hate so much as to see a woman in dirty
finery; and pure fresh white is the prettiest thing she
can wear. If you ladies dressed to please us gentlemen,
you would never appear in any thing else.
However, I don’t mean to interfere in what you’ll
say, Emily, I don’t understand; only, Lucy, whatever
you do decide on, let it be fresh and clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There Lucy, now I have your husband on my
side, you have nothing to say,” cried Emily. “And
to be fresh and clean, things must be new. You
men understand effect,” she continued, turning to
her brother-in-law, “though you are not much at
details. And now let us be off to Madame Dudevant’s;
I want to see some costumes she was to
have in this morning—and you can speak to her
about your dress at the same time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think I must have Madame Dudevant,”
said Lucy inquiringly. “She is such an extortionate
creature; I could get Henrietta in the house for a
couple of days⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For pity’s sake don’t think of Henrietta, Lucy,”
said Emily; “there’s no use in getting new materials
if she is to spoil them. And what signifies a few
dollars more or less in the making; for after all it’s
the fit and air of a dress that gives it all its effect.
Dudevant asks rather more, perhaps, than others—but
really she is worth it. She is the only person in
town who knows how to do any thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” said Lucy plaintively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you sigh so, Lucy,” said her
husband smiling, “over Madame Dudevant’s superiority?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s just Lucy,” said Emily laughing.
“She always was so. She thinks any thing will do
for her until it comes to the point, and then nothing
but the best satisfies her. With all her scruples, she
always ends where I begin. But then she has such
a plaintive way of going to work, that she always
thinks, and what is worse, you all agree with her,
that she is so much more economical than I⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Emily,” said Lucy expostulatingly, “I am
sure I would be glad to go as the ‘White Lady,’ if
you and Tom would let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you think, my dear—but I know how it
would be; you would keep Henrietta for a week in
the house botching up a dress, which, of course,
would be a fright; and then, just at the last minute,
you would come to the conclusion it would never
do, and go off in a hurry to Dudevant’s to order
something decent—and so, besides your dress, you
would have your failure to pay for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coolidge laughed outright at this picture of his
wife’s economy, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Lucy, as we can’t afford double expenses,
I think you’ll have to give up what Emily calls
your ‘failure.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These ‘failures’ are mighty expensive things,
let me tell you,” said Emily seriously; “and I’ll just
give you this warning, Tom, your wife is very fond
of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Emily, say no more,” said Lucy entreatingly,
“and I’ll do any thing you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the carriage has been waiting this half
hour,” said her sister. “Do you come back to
dinner,” said she to her brother-in-law, “for I mean
to keep Lucy to-day, and then we will settle this
evening about Bully’s head and ears, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they drove to Madame Dudevant’s. Emily
gave a rapid sketch of the character her sister was
to take, which the Frenchwoman caught with a
tact and quickness that would have been enough
to make a slow, sober Englishwoman think she had
been a reader of Shakspeare from her youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I understand—something very light and
pretty; two, tree tunics—a light broderie on each.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would not a little silver lace,” said Mrs.
Coolidge, looking anxious, “do, madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silver lace?” said the Frenchwoman interrogatively.
“What you call silver lace, madame?
You like tinsel?” with a shrug of such ineffable contempt,
that Lucy colored spite of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A light embroidery would be much handsomer,
Lucy,” said Emily. “I don’t like silver lace myself,
it has a sort of livery look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so,” said the queen of mantua-makers, now
directing her remarks to Emily, “what you call
vulgar. If madame will have tree tunics with a
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
delicat broderie, de sleeve de same, I have a
young woman who work beautiful⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy looked distressed, and said, “I don’t want
to go to much expense, madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expense! oh no, madame, it so light it cost noting
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better leave it to madame, Lucy,” said
Emily; “I see she understands what you want. She
will make it pretty, and not too expensive. Madame,”
turning to the Frenchwoman, “Mrs. Coolidge is
married, you know,” she added smiling, “and has a
husband to consult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said the graceful <span class='it'>artiste</span> smiling, “when
you husband see you look pretty, he tink noting of
the cost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that, madame,” said Lucy laughing,
unconsciously pleased at the flattery. “But you’ll
make it as reasonable as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certain, madame; I make it as cheap as I can
afford. You shall like your dress. And you, mademoiselle,
will come to-morrow; I have some new
costume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fancy Ball, which had been the talk of the
town for a month, went off brilliantly. Emily’s
dress was Madame Dudevant’s <span class='it'>chef d’œuvre</span>, and the
delicate Titania looked the creation of a poet. But
Tom, as Bully Bottom, was glorious. The young
husband and wife were conspicuous amid even that
distinguished throng; and Lucy, proud of her husband’s
wit, entered with delight into the spirit of the
whole; and he, as Madame Dudevant truly prophecied,
when “he saw her look so pretty, thought
nothing of the cost.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Tom, dear,” said has wife one morning at breakfast,
about the close of the first year of their marriage,
“What do you mean to do about this house?
I find that the rents on all this row have risen fifty
dollars. I suppose our landlord will raise on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied her husband, knitting his brow
with an anxious expression, “he told me so yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rent is already high enough,” rejoined his
wife, “for a house of this size, with none of the new
improvements, too. Had we not better give it up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coolidge looked annoyed, and said, “The moving
would make up the difference of the rent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but then we might get a better house for
the same money up town; and by taking a lease⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t take a house on lease,” answered her
husband quickly, “these landlords have one so in
their power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they will lease I know,” pursued Lucy, “for
Mrs. Saville told me yesterday that they had taken
their house for three years. The one next door is
to rent on the same terms, with baths on every
story, and some new contrivance by which all the
coal is taken up stairs by turning some crank, or
something or other,” continued Mrs. Coolidge with
all the enthusiasm of a young housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” interrupted Tom with some impatience,
“we could not take it if the whole work of
the house was performed by machinery instead of
servants; for, to tell you the truth, Lucy,” he added
gravely, “I am behind hand in the rent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behind hand in the rent!” exclaimed Lucy aghast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but you need not look so horror struck,
Lucy, it’s only the last quarter. I should not like
to leave, however, without having paid up every
thing; so we must stay where we are for this year.
Cranstoun is anxious we should, and so don’t trouble
me about what is due; and upon the whole it is
more convenient to pay fifty dollars more in the
course of the year, than to move now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy looked very serious, and then said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am perfectly willing to stay here, Tom, but I
really think we pay Cranstoun enough now; it’s
unconscionable to ask more. Did you tell him about
the new houses, and remind him that this has no
baths?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear,” replied Tom, “you can’t expostulate
with a man you owe. Next year we can do
better, but for the present we must put up with it
as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But to pay fifty dollars,” pursued Lucy, in a dissatisfied
tone, for she was thinking of fifty things on
which she would prefer laying out fifty dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must do the best I can, Lucy,” replied her husband.
“And now, I am sorry to say it, Lucy, but
we must retrench in something—we don’t make the
two ends meet this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t we?” said Lucy sadly, “that’s very bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so it is. But don’t look so doleful about it,
Lucy, for Heaven’s sake,” said her husband; “it is
not so bad after all—for though we are behind hand,
it is not a great deal. We have only to cut off
something else next year, and then all will come
right again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said, trying to speak cheerfully,
“where shall we begin. We can’t do very well
with a servant less. The cook, of course, we must
have. The chambermaid does the washing. The
man—we can get a waiter-girl instead of a man, if
you are willing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coolidge hesitated, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is only exchanging one servant for another;
and I hate girl waiters. I never can order a woman;
and then I must hire some one to clean my
boots—and there’s the putting in coal. The difference
of wages soon makes itself up, you see, in
these trifles that you want all the time. These sort
of economies only make one uncomfortable, and
save in the end little or nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” she replied mournfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can give up the curtains for the back parlour,”
rejoined he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they are ordered,” replied Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” he continued, “but I dare say
Lambert would take them off our hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” said Lucy; “but then he will
make you pay something if he does. They are cut
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
for our windows—and you always lose upon any
thing they take back after it is cut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presume so; but that is not much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes it is, considerable,” said Lucy, who, woman-like,
clung to her curtains. “And it does seem a
pity to pay for what one has not; particularly, too,
when money is not over plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True enough,” said Tom. “Well, we’ll see
about it. I’ll see what Lambert says about it. If
he is in no hurry to be paid, why, in the course of
six months, I can settle it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Lucy, “he gives six months’
credit—that is what they all do. No one expects to
be paid before six months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if that’s so,” answered Tom, “the thing may
as well rest as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that room were not so cold,” pursued Lucy, “I
should not care so much about the curtains; but we
really suffered for the want of them last winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, they are ordered,” said her husband,
“and as you think Lambert wont take them off our
hands without making me pay something down—so
there let it rest. I don’t feel inclined to pay for
what we don’t have, which is, as you say, provoking
enough. In fact, I find it pretty tough to pay for
what we do have, let alone what we don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, Coolidge found it more convenient to
have some hundreds <span class='it'>charged</span>, than to pay a bonus
down, small though it might be. So Lucy secured
her curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we must economize in something, you say,”
continued Lucy. “I wish I knew where to begin,”
she added, anxiously. “I don’t know what we can
cut off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have not many superfluities, certainly,” rejoined
her husband. “However, we must retrench
as much as we can. I don’t know exactly in what—but
as a general thing, Lucy. You must have an
eye to saving all you can this winter; and next year
I hope it wont be necessary. So good morning,
love—it is time I was off.” And Tom took his hat
and left his wife, who sat ruminating with a very
doleful face, just where he left her, until the cook
came for her orders for dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Coolidges kept a good table, usually—for
Tom was fond of bringing in a friend or two occasionally
to dinner; but, full of her new economies,
Lucy, instead of ordering as usual, asked the cook
“if there was not cold lamb enough left of yesterday
to make a stew;” and that, with some mashed potatoes,
was all she ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wont I cook the pheasants that have just
come in?” inquired the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Lucy, who felt too poor to eat
pheasants, “put them in the larder—it is so cold
they will keep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I fricassee or roast the chickens?” pursued
the cook; “there are two pair in the larder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the stew will be enough,” answered Mrs.
Coolidge, and the cook left the room with a toss,
wondering “what was in the wind now,” quite
puzzled by her mistress’ sad manner of ordering
dinner, and sudden notion “of having nothing worth
the cooking.” “I guess Mr. Coolidge wont like
stew,” thought the offended <span class='it'>chef de cuisine</span>, as she
set to work chopping meat and vegetables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was right this time, at any rate—for Coolidge
came home to dinner, bringing a friend with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he took his seat at table, his consternation
could not be concealed at the sight of the stew
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why Lucy, what’s the meaning of this?” said
he, looking at his wife. “Did not the man bring
home the marketing? I’ll speak to him to-morrow.
It’s too bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy colored very much, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he came at the usual hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, looking as if he expected her to
say something more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She colored still more painfully as she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not think you would be home to dinner—and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I understand,” said her husband laughing,
though embarrassed, “you did not happen to feel
hungry when the cook came for orders, and so
thought you did not want any dinner, and that I
should stay down town. Well, Hastings,” turning
to his friend, “as Mrs. Coolidge wont give us any
thing to eat, I’ll see we have something fit to drink.
Here Joe,” turning to the man, “take this key and
go into the wine cellar, and bring me one of those
bottles with a card label—and see that you don’t
shake it coming up stairs. There,” he said, “Hastings,
try that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s exquisite,” returned his friend, “wine for
an emperor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, what with the wine and the stew, Mr.
Hastings seemed to make a very good dinner,
though Lucy felt as if she would be glad to get under
the table, and Tom did not feel much better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Lucy, dearest,” said he, as the door closed
upon their guest, “what did you mean by ordering
such a dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears started in her eyes as she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Tom, I did not know you meant to bring
home any one with you; and as we were talking of
economizing this morning, and as there was plenty
of cold lamb left of yesterday⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never was so mortified in my life,” rejoined
her husband. “There’s no use, Lucy, in going to
extremes. We may economize without going to
such pitiful lengths as that. However, there’s
no use in talking about it now. It’s over, and I
gave <a id='hast'></a>Hastings wine that more than compensated
for your dinner. It was some of my father’s best
old Madeira. I’ve only a couple of dozen of it, but
I felt I must give the poor devil something to make
it up, or he would feel as if I had insulted him in
bringing him home to a stew and potatoes! So,
Lucy, even on the score of economy, your dinner
did not answer its end. There’s no use in saving
a pair of chickens, if one must give a bottle of five
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
dollar wine to make up for their absence. This, I
think,” he added laughing, “is what Emily would
call one of your ‘economical failures.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coolidge was certainly as good-tempered a man
as ever lived; but a bad dinner, when one has a
friend, will try the best of husbands—and he was
vexed, in spite of himself. However, he said no
more; and Lucy resolved she never would put him
to the test again, in that way at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feast or famine! hey Lucy?” he said the next
day, as he took his place at table. “Roast chickens,
stewed chickens, pheasants! Any removes,” he continued,
laughing as he looked at his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not mean to have all this cooked to day,”
said Lucy, apologizingly, “but a thaw has come on,
and cook said the poultry would not keep any
longer, as it had already been two days in the larder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I understand,” replied her husband, “we
must eat yesterday’s dinner and today’s too.
That’s it, is it? I wish Hastings dined with us to-day
instead of yesterday, and then I might have
kept my old wine that I grudge him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah Tom,” said Lucy beseechingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Lucy, we need not economise in the
matter of mirth, need we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, when it is at my expense, Tom,” she
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you think me extravagant in that respect,”
he said. “Well, no matter, Lucy; if you are a
young housekeeper, you are the dearest, sweetest-tempered
little wife a man ever had. Only, love,
when you order dinner, particularly a stew, just
think of Mr. Hastings, will you? Let us economise
in any thing but hospitality. There, now, I’ll say
no more about it, I promise. Moreover, I wont
tell Emily—now am I not good?”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucy,” said Emily, “we have taken our season
tickets for the Opera near the centre of the house,
Nos. 22, 24. Mr. Coolidge had better take yours
joining ours, so that if he happens to be engaged, or
don’t want to go, or any thing, you can go with us.
At any rate, it will be pleasanter to be together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not going to take a season ticket,” said
Lucy,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” inquired Emily. “It’s cheaper, you
know, than paying by the single ticket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no cheap way of going to the Opera,”
said Coolidge, rather rudely, as Emily thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It costs something, certainly,” she replied.
“Every thing does. But I think it’s quite as economical
as any other amusement, and much more
delightful. It’s a great improvement, too, Lucy,
to one’s own music; and with your voice you
ought to take every opportunity of hearing good
music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accomplished wives are somewhat expensive
articles for a poor man,” said Tom. “A taste for
music costs no trifle in these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is a taste for yachting cheaper?” said Emily,
looking at him as if she thought him a bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom colored at this, having just joined a yachting
club, composed of some of the most expensive
young men in town, and looked very angry, but
said nothing—what could he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, if he was angry, so was Emily—and
Lucy looked fairly frightened between the two.
She turned the conversation as quickly as she
could, and the subject dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said to her afterward,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucy, if you would like to go the Opera, I’ll take
a season ticket for you with your family. When I
want to go, I can buy a ticket at the door, as I don’t
care about going every night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, Tom, I don’t care about going at all;
and you know I never wish to go without you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked very much perplexed and worried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t bear to have you give up a pleasure you
are so fond of,” he pursued. “And then it seems so
selfish. I wish to heavens I had not joined that
confounded club. I’ll give it up as soon as the year
is out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am sure, Tom,” said his sweet wife, “you
require relaxation and exercise. I think you’ve
been a great deal better this summer in consequence
of having joined the club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he did not seem at ease. In fact, Emily’s
fling at his being able to gratify his own tastes while
he found fault with Lucy’s, nettled him. And, moreover,
he was honest and generous enough to feel its
truth. Besides, no man likes the insinuation of
selfishness—if there is any truth in the charge, so
much the worse. So, though it was inconvenient,
Tom made a point of Lucy’s having a season ticket—whether
he took some money he had meant to
appropriate to house expenses, I don’t know, but I
should not be surprised; at any rate they were much
behind hand this year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a bill now at the grocer’s—butcher’s
ditto—and “paid on account” what they did pay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty dollars more was added next year to the
house-rent—and yet they did not move. Lucy
looked embarrassed when she was asked “if they
meant to remain,” and “why they did not move up
town?” and Tom was almost rude when similar inquiries
were made of him. That, indeed, was not
the unusual thing now that it had once been. Tom
was growing cross. He was harassed and fretted,
and often answered hastily where he had no right
to do so; particularly to his sweet, pretty little wife,
who, to do him justice, he did love with all his heart
and soul—but that was no excuse for being cross to
her, as he was sometimes, when she handed him
a bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Lucy, what is this? Five dollars for ice!
I’ve paid that bill before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, you have not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave you the money, I am sure. Do you take
receipts? for if you don’t, they always send the bill
a second time.” No one but Tom would ever have
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
thought of any body’s sending him a bill a <span class='it'>second</span>
time. If they got paid once, they did very well.
“And I can’t afford to be paying bills two or three
times over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, dear, I always take receipts—and this
I know has not been paid. It has been sent in two
or three times, but it has not been paid, I know.
Here’s the baker’s account just sent in,” continued
Lucy, who thought while she was in for a disagreeable
subject, she might as well go through
with it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty dollars for bread!” exclaimed he, eyeing
the sum total; “why it must be a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “it is correct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Lucy,” said he, “there must be great waste
somewhere; and,” he added angrily, “I can’t afford
it. Twenty dollars for bread! It’s enormous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been running a good while,” said Lucy,
meekly. “See, it begins in June.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, no matter when it begins,” said he,
impatiently, “I can’t pay it now, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened just then, and Emily came in.
Lucy was always glad to see her, doubly so now, as
she interrupted a <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> that threatened to be unpleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come, Lucy,” she said, “to ask you to go
and look at bonnets. The French importations open
to-day. Mamma will join us presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me,” said Tom, somewhat rudely,
“that you women spend all your time running
round after finery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emily looked at him for a minute as if she had a
great mind to retort, but Lucy quickly interposed
with,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want the benefit of my taste to aid you in
selecting for yourself, Emily, I am ready to go. I
don’t mean to get any thing for myself. I don’t
want a hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may not mean to get one,” said Emily,
“but that you want one is certain. Yours is shabby
enough in all conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will do well enough for the present,” said
Lucy in a dejected tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t wear a summer bonnet all winter,
Lucy; and if you are going to get one at all, you
might as well get it now, and have the comfort of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom looked cross, however; and though what
Emily said was true, Lucy did not feel as if she
ought to indulge herself in even getting what she
must have while <a id='hebe'></a>he was out of temper. It was
wonderful how much richer she felt when he was
in a good humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sutherland now joined her daughters, and
after a little while said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Emily, I have just come from Dudevant’s.
The hats don’t open to-day. She was going to send
you word. It was a mistake of the printer’s. To-morrow
is the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will call for you to-morrow, Lucy,” said
Emily. “And now, as it is late, we may as well
go, mamma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How cross Coolidge grows,” said Emily, as they
drove off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is any thing the matter, do you think,” inquired
Mrs. Sutherland anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Emily, “nothing that I could see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, as Emily called at an early
hour at her sister’s, as by appointment, Coolidge,
who had not yet gone out, looked up and said pleasantly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hats the order of the day, hey, Emily?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as Lucy rose hastily from the breakfast
table and tied on hers, he added,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That does look shabby enough, Lucy. Do get a
white bonnet this time. I do like to see a woman
in a white hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They soil too soon,” replied his wife, “and beside
are only fit for full dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he replied, “can’t you have another for
common wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom had got some money, that was clear. The
very atmosphere of the house seemed changed
since yesterday. The sunshine was to be taken
advantage of however, and Lucy went up to him
and said something to him in a low voice, to which
he answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t this morning. Tell her to send it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emily had heard this often enough to understand
what it meant. The hat was to be charged, that
was evident. However, as it was to be bought,
that was all she cared about. The rest only concerned
Tom and Madame Dudevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These fits of liberality and good humor, however,
were becoming rare. Coolidge was certainly
growing cross. His naturally fine, generous
temper was becoming clouded by his embarrassments.
When a man is harassed he is apt to forget
himself even toward those he loves best. And he
did love his little wife dearly, notwithstanding that
he frequently spoke almost harshly to her. And
this again acted upon her poor thing. She was becoming
nervous and timid, and sorry are we to add—fretful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do keep quiet, Harry,” she would say to her
eldest child, a fine spirited boy, in the tone of a person
who had the toothache, “You are enough to
set one distracted with your noise. Now put your
blocks away and sit down and read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Harry, being in the midst of a high game of
fun with his little sister, did not want to throw down
the castle he was building, would say,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mamma, pray let me finish. I don’t want
to read. I wont do any harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How troublesome you are, Harry. Do as I bid
you. And, Fanny, do you go up into the nursery.
You make too much noise here, both of you. Go,
nurse wants you up stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the poor children’s pleasures were often
cut short, because mamma had a bill preying upon
her mind, that made the sound of mirth absolutely
painful to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet Coolidge was doing a good business.
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
His profits were quite equal perhaps to his expenses,
if he could only have paid as he went along. But
as it was, he was working against tide all the time.
He was forever paying back accounts, while the
present ones went rolling up, inferior articles at
high prices, at a fearful rate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poverty begets poverty, that’s certain. And
then it brings such a train of evils—big and little—and
the smaller ones are worse to bear than the
great. A man who has his pocket always drained
of change is not a pleasant companion, at least not
to his wife. Let him be ever so affectionate he
will be unreasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three shillings! What do you want three shillings
for, Lucy?” he would say as impatiently sometimes
as if she had asked for a hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the girl who has been sewing here to-day,
dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me that girl is sewing here forever.
It’s three shillings here and three shillings there all
the time,” he would say pettishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall you want me next week, Mrs. Coolidge?”
asked the girl, as she was paid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she replied in a melancholy tone; “no, I
will finish the rest of the work myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then perhaps feeling good-humored, he would
say affectionately,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do, Lucy, put that eternal work-basket aside.
I hate to see you stitching away so the whole time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must finish these things for the children,” she
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s no matter for the children. You look
fagged to death, dear. Send for that girl. Indeed
I’d rather give fifty dollars than see you wear yourself
out as you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, if Coolidge would only have given the fifty,
or twenty, or even ten dollars, instead of talking
about it, it would have saved his poor wife many a
side-ache, and back-ache, and heart-ache to boot, for
she almost <a id='stit'></a>stitched her soul out to save five dollars.
But there was nothing she would not rather do than
ask for money. It was bad enough to be obliged to
hand the necessary house-bills. As to her own milliner’s
and <a id='maker'></a>mantua-maker’s accounts! the mental
agony she went through for them would have been
almost ludicrous, so disproportioned was the amount
of suffering to the amount charged, had it not been
so sincere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catch me going to Lucy’s again to spend an
evening,” said one of her younger sisters to Emily,
now the rich and gay Mrs. Woodberry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? How was it—what was the matter?”
asked Emily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure I do not know—nothing that I could
see. But you would have supposed there was a
corpse in the house, certainly. There was but one
light, and that shaded, on the table where Lucy
and the children sat—she sewing, they studying.
And if the poor little souls spoke loud, or laughed,
Lucy hushed them at once, and with such reproachful
looks, <a id='asif'></a>as if they had done something very naughty,
and were shockingly unfeeling. And Mr. Coolidge
scarcely raised his eyes from his paper, but to say
something cross two or three times during the course
of the evening. And poor Lucy sat stitching away,
looking the image of grief and despair. If both the
children had been up stairs dying of scarlet fever,
she could not have looked worse. I asked her
what was the matter, and she replied, ‘Nothing.’
But, really, if people look so about ‘nothing,’ they deserve
to have ‘something’ to look miserable about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it was some bill or other—the old
story,” replied Mrs. Woodberry. “Lucy is so silly to
let Coolidge be so cross about things that are no
more her fault than his. If she had only fired up in
the beginning, and told him, as I should have done,
when he scolded about the butcher and baker, &amp;c.,
‘That he <a id='ate'></a>ate five times as much bread as I did; and
as to meat, I did not care if I did not eat a morsel
from one week’s end to another,’ and followed it up
by ordering no dinner, I think she might have taught
him better manners. Men are so detestable,” she
continued, with vexation, “one would think it was
not enough to be poor, but they must add to the
charm by being cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you think poverty a great evil,” said Susan
with sorrowful earnestness—for there was a certain
young lawyer she thought very captivating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An evil—to be sure it is,” replied Mrs. Woodberry,
who, being very rich and expensive, thought
there was no living without money, and plenty of it,
too. “Just look at Lucy—did you ever see such a
poor, forlorn, faded, fretful looking thing as she has
become. You don’t remember her, Susan, when she
married. You would scarcely believe what a sweet,
fresh, pretty young creature she was. And now look
at her! She looks as if she might have gone in the
wash with those poor old faded calicoes of hers, that
have been rubbed and pounded till there’s scarce a
shade of color in them. And Coolidge, too—what a
pleasant, merry, joyous tempered fellow he was. I
never shall forget them the first time they appeared
in society after their marriage. It was at a Fancy
Ball. She went as Titania, he as Bully Bottom.
They were the admiration and life of the room.
One would not have thought, to have seen them
then, how they would look fifteen years later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said old Mrs. Rutledge, an aunt of the
Sutherlands, joining in the conversation for the first
time, “there I don’t agree with you, Emily. It was just
the beginning that might have foretold the ending.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so?” said both sisters, looking up at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have lived too fast. Poverty, my dear
Susan, is an evil, nay, a curse, or not, just as people
choose to make it. Be prudent, live within your
means, and small though they may be, there will
always be enough for happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Susan, whose feelings were deeply interested in
this question, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, aunt, do you think it is Lucy’s fault that her
husband is cross and poor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely, my dear. A man should govern
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
himself, and his own destiny. But still, I think a
prudent, <span class='it'>firm</span> wife, a fine balance-wheel. Lucy did
not use her influence rightly. She never seemed to
know the power she had in her hands. She rather
encouraged her husband’s extravagance; and it has
been <span class='it'>debt</span> that has been the ruin of their happiness.
Had they begun differently, it would have ended
differently. God only knows, now, poor things,
where <a id='they'></a>they will wind up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The error was, they started wrong.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span><h1><a id='lit'></a>THE PRESENT ROMANTIC SCHOOL OF FRENCH LITERATURE.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>ALEXANDRE DUMAS’ HAMLET.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have often taken occasion to express our opinion on
the present romantic school of French literature, as opposed
to what may be designated as the classical literature
of that country. We think that the French have succeeded
better in their old vocation than in their new one,
and that with all their vivacity and sprightliness they are
not a very romantic people. The romantic school of
France is not of national growth; but has been transferred
from England and Germany, both in prose and poetry.
There is nothing in the character of the French that is
romantic, their imagination resembling much more that of
the Greeks and Romans, and their love of glory being
much more classical than that of any modern notion. To
an Englishman, an American, or a German, French stage
logic appears absolutely destitute of interest or meaning,
but to a Frenchman it is eminently full of truth and significance,
though the subjects are, with but few exceptions,
taken from ancient history. Racine’s Achilles and Agamemnon
are true Frenchmen, and his Alexander much
more resembles Louis XIV., Conde, Turenne, or Napoleon,
than Shakspeare’s Brutus resembles Charles Fox, or
his Julius Cæsar, Oliver Cromwell. The English and the
German poets depict men; the French only Frenchmen,
though the hero of the play be a Roman or a Greek; and
hence their old literature, as we may now call it, is eminently
national. There is no incoherence in Achilles calling
Iphigenia “Madame,” nor in her calling him “Monsieur;”
for if Achilles and Iphigenia had spoken French
to each other, as they are obliged to do on the French
stage, they could not, without a gross breach of politeness,
have used any other title in addressing each other. It is
sufficiently classical that Achilles should call Iphigenia
“Madame,” considering that she was but betrothed to him.
In modern language she would have been called “<span class='it'>Mademoiselle</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who imagine the language of Racine and Voltaire
unnatural and forced, need but acquaint themselves
with the French people, and they will soon perceive that
even the French people of the present day think, feel and
act through the Greek idiom, and in conformity with their
classic models. Not the Greeks in the Morea, or in Syria,
who are nothing but Turks and Jews and Frank rabble,
without a country, and without national associations, but
the <span class='it'>Parisians</span> are the true representatives of the Greeks
among the moderns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in common life, in their harangues in the Chambers,
in the pleadings of their lawyers, the charges of
their judges, and, to a certain extent, even in their periodical
writings, the French are admirably classical, even at
the expense of cogent reasoning; that is, they are modern
Greeks and Romans, and resemble them also in their national
character. We have, of course, no reference to the
Spartans; but to the Athenians the French bear a goodly
resemblance, and, as far as that goes, they are decidedly
agreeable—though Heathens in more than one sense of the
word. No modern people are as much alive to wit, sarcasm
and epigrammatic conversation as the Parisians—and
there is no other mob in Europe as much capable of
relishing a joke, or a witticism, or of being inspired by a
happy impromptu as the <span class='it'>canaille</span> of the French metropolis.
With all its fierce and ungovernable passions, it is capable
of noble and generous emotions, and of practicing, at least
for a time, a degree of self-denial which is bordering on
the classical. No modern people lives as much in public
as the French, or is as much dependent on popular applause—none
is so keenly alive to national renown, none
so fond of pleasure, of dramatic amusements, of the arts.
Louis Philippe thought his throne and his dynasty less in
danger from the opposition press, than from the genius of
caricaturists. The spirit of the latter the people seized in
an instant, and the passions excited by them were truly
ungovernable. Hence the public sale of caricatures was
one of the first things interdicted by the September laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the restoration of the Bourbons in 1815, the French
romantic school of literature was ushered into existence;
the three Coriphaes of which were De Lavigne, De Lamartine,
and Chateaubriand. Schiller, Young, and Milton,
seemed to have been their models; but the modern prose
writers soon followed the lyric poets in their imitations of
the romantic schools of England and Germany; and we
have since had French pupils of Fielding, Smollet, Hoffmann,
and Jean Paul Richter. Eugene Sue at first imitated
Fennimore Cooper; but he soon gave into the “tendency
novels,” on the Miss Martineau style of treating
political and domestic economy. But his great genius, and
the rich resources of his imagination, soon made him shoot
by his dull originals, and he has since grappled successfully
with religion, morals, and politics; in all which combats
he may be said to have come out victorious; for he has
nearly, if not altogether, <span class='it'>annihilated</span> his antagonists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Feuilleton literature which has grown in proportion
to the decline of essays and memoirs, has opened a new
field to the romantic pens of France, and has made that
style of writing popular with the masses. Since then the
abuse of it has passed all bounds; half a dozen writers have
absorbed the <span class='it'>Feuilletons</span> of all the large sheets published in
the capital—so that talents less known and appreciated
must content themselves with some feudal tenure under
one of these literary lords; for it must not be imagined that
writers like Sue, Alexandre Dumas, Soulié, &amp;c., do their
own works, or are put to the necessity of even inventing
the incidents of their stories. All this is done for them by
their literary vassals, who work for five francs a day,
while their masters, who occasionally correct the phraseology
of some chapter, but whose principal business it is,
when matters come to a crisis, to furnish the <span class='it'><a id='denou'></a>dénouement</span>
and the conclusion, to which they put their <span class='it'>name</span>, receive
hundreds of thousands for their contributions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what the feudal writers of the romantic school of
France have not attempted till lately was to imitate Shakspeare
on the stage. Hitherto the modern dramas of Victor
Hugo were more in the melo-dramatic line, and as such
admirably adapted to the taste of the frequenters of the
theatre <span class='it'>de la Porte St. Martin</span>. But Victor Hugo was a
brave man, and with the popularity acquired among the
masses, soon forced his way to the French academy, as
Lucien Bonaparte, at the head of his grenadiers, forced the
legislative assembly of the republic to close its sessions.
He got in and seated himself, and has since had strength
enough to draw some of his best friends after him, notwithstanding
all the opposition of the classic Molé, who
has even pronounced a discourse against Alfred de Vigny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexandre Dumas, the Créol of the Isle of Bourbon (the
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
French use the term <span class='it'>Créol</span> as a sort of embellishment to a
Mulatto) is the greatest literary factotum of France now
living. He imitates every thing—history, comedy, tragedy,
novels, and romance, and will with great difficulty be kept
from “the forty” <span class='it'>qui en <a id='sav'></a>savant comme quatre</span>.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> His
Monte Christo is an imitation of “The Wandering Jew;”
his Age of Louis XIV. and XV., an important commentary
on Voltaire; but his <span class='it'>chef d’œuvre</span> we have now before
us;—it is nothing less than a new version of <span class='sc'>Shakspeare’s
Hamlet</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present Feuilleton literature of France is, properly
speaking, the commercial or shop-keeper literature of the
day, in which a few thoughts abstracted from some greater
works are carefully spun out and disposed of at retail
prices; or, to use a still better figure, a ragout with all sorts
of spices, but made from a piece of meat which has served
to appease the appetite of hundreds. There is a perfect
dearth of ideas in all of them, and a morbid desire for ornament.
The form is everywhere more valuable than the substance—the
elegance of style superior to the naked thought.
It is the process of the gold-beater, who, with a single grain
of that precious metal, covers the backs of a whole library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taste for Shakspeare is, in France, of recent origin.
Since the performance of Macready on the French
boards, Parisian audiences have become acquainted with
ghosts, witches, and the whole laboratory of philosophical
superstition in which the British bard surpassed all others,
ancient and modern. Still Shakspeare remained unintelligible
or unpalatable to many, notwithstanding the
learned reviews of the <span class='it'>Revue de deux Mondes</span>, and the
<span class='it'>Revue de Paris</span>, both of which strove to show that though
in point of abstract genius Shakspeare may have possessed
more than Racine, Voltaire, and Corneille put together,
still he lacked that scenic arrangement, and that peculiar
close connection between cause and effect which distinguishes
the dramatic works of France. “Shakspeare’s
Hamlet is a philosophical dissertation,” said a French
writer, “in a dramatic form.” “There is no <span class='it'>reason</span> for
Hamlet’s madness”—“none in the world for Ophelia’s
ravings, who ought to spurn the taunts and insults of her
coward lover,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these criticisms have moved Alexandre Dumas to try
his hand at the work, and to correct the logic and dramatic
arrangement of “the British savage, who occasionally
found a pearl on a dunghill.” The work of the French
Creole is admirable of its kind; but equally “unintelligible”
in regard to the scenic arrangements. Hamlet is
as much a coward in the French play as he is in the English,
only a little less philosophical; and instead of Laertes
and the king being killed, the queen poisoned, and what
not, the ghost takes charge of eternal justice and finishes
them off himself. Why he does not do so, in the first act,
immediately after his appearance, is an enigma; but as
that would have saved the remaining four acts—which
would not have answered the views of Alexandre Dumas—it
was necessary that Hamlet—the only character who
survives in the French play—should do some courting, and
the queen and king some talking and feasting, all according
to the rules of the <span class='it'>French</span> drama. We cannot refrain, by
way of a rich treat, from giving the readers of the magazine
the closing scene of <span class='it'>Dumas’s play</span>. It will speak for
itself, and save us the necessity of further comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One can see that Dumas snatches a grace beyond the
reach of the usual drama. The ghost acts the part of the
Lord’s messenger, and pronounces sentence on each culprit.
The queen is “a woman here,” and “an angel there;”
because she loved much—the king is too well served in
going to the devil, Laertes dies with some hope of salvation;
but Hamlet lives to repent of his sins; having by
his cowardice killed four persons instead of one! This is
French stage logic. As to the language it is the most trite
and commonplace, that one can hear in <span class='it'>front</span> of the theatre
from the hackmen; and the tragic muse is certainly not
that one of the hallowed nine which particularly favors
the author of <span class='sc'>Monte Christo</span>.</p>

Boston: Wm. D. Ticknor &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a volume to make “the cold reviewer’s rhyme-freezing
face,” melt into smiles. It is the production of a
young painter, who has already won an honorable reputation
as an artist. Several of the poems have been printed
in various periodicals, and in that form attracted considerable
attention: but the majority, we believe, are now published
for the first time. They evince refinement of thought
and sentiment, richness and warmth of fancy, and singular
delicacy and strength in the use of language. Perhaps the
finest characteristic of their diction is the feeling they display
of the harmony of sound and color, in the expression
of thought and emotion. The music of the verse corresponds
to the imagery which flushes through it, and thus
the figures which the poet’s prolific fancy conjures up, are
all endowed with life and motion—or rather seem to make
the harmony in which they move. His thoughts and sentiment
give continual evidence of being born in music.
This is a test which few rhymes will bear, and of itself
proves the possession of the true poetic feeling. The
poetry of Mr. Read is essentially musical thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the excellent pieces contained in this volume,
we would call the attention of our readers to the dreamy
beauty of Christine and the Bride of Dottenburg—the elevated
feeling which animates the dilating imaginations of
the sonnet “To the Master Bards”—the mystical charm
of The Winnower, Inez, Arise, The Twins, the Windy
Night—and the pensive beauty and sweetness of A Leaf
From the Past and Sunlight on the Threshold. Throughout
the volume is manifested an imagination to discern and
express the poetical aspects of things. We hope that a
collection of poems so rich in thought and feeling, and
richer still in promise, will have the extended circulation
it merits.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Dealings with the Firm of <a id='dom'></a>Dombey and Son, Wholesale,
Retail, and for Exportation. By Charles Dickens. With
Illustrations by H. K. Browne. New York: Wiley &amp;
Putnam.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From the numbers already published of this new novel
by Dickens, we think it promises to be one of the most
entertaining of his works. With some drawback on the
excellence of the characterization, arising from his desire
to produce startling comic effects, the characteristics of the
work are the same as those displayed in the others, and
they are as good. Mr. Dombey is overcharged in the
delineation almost to caricature, but he still vividly suggests
the character intended to be hit. The class to which he
belongs richly deserves satire, as pomposity is as habitual
a vice in a large number of Englishmen as the
hypocrisy of Pecksniff. Miss Tox promises to be as interesting
as Miss Miggs, in “Barnaby Rudge.” Mrs. Chick
will give room for much satire on the obvious hypocrisies
of character. Polly Richards is a grand portrait, overflowing
with humanity, and true to the first principles of
the heart. Miss Nipper is a good specimen of the snappish
domestic, proudly vulgar and insolently low. Florence,
the heroine, is an exquisite creation, not yet fully developed,
but as promising almost as Little Nell. Walter is
capital, and will go directly to the heart of all boys of
spirit. The other characters are of various degrees of
merit and originality, but all add something to the interest
of the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peculiar humor of Dickens, or his power of blending
satire wit, fancy and humor together, is very prominent
in “<a id='dom2'></a>Dombey and Son.” His pathos is no less observable.
The felicities of expression scattered over the narrative,
would alone reward its patient perusal. The style of
Dickens is worthy of study for its beautiful and sparkling
peculiarities. It is one of the most original in English
literature, and is the exact measure of his genius. His
qualities as a novelist cannot be disconnected from his
style. A criticism of his diction involves a statement of
all his powers and peculiarities, for they interpenetrate it,
and give it all its life and character.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Nell Gwynne: or the Court of the Stuarts. An Historical
Romance. By W. Harrison Ainsworth: Philada. Carey
&amp; Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ainsworth is well known as the most prominent of the
English novelists of intrigue, rascality, and horror. In the
present work he has a fine subject for his peculiar powers—the
delineation of the court of Charles II.—a good-natured
rascal, who bartered away the interests and
honor of England for money and mistresses, and who was
surrounded by companions worthy of himself. Nell
Gwynne was one of the least vixenish of his mistresses,
and she is the heroine of Mr. Ainsworth’s novel. The
opening scene of the book is appropriately laid in “The
Devil’s Alley;” and through this alley most of the characters
go. Mr. Ainsworth himself has been journeying
through it ever since he commenced his career as a romancer;
and he has been the humble means of leading
others in the same path.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Lives of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, Herbert, and Sanderson.
By Isaak Walton. New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam.
2 Parts. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is singular that this should be the first American
edition of so celebrated a work. Isaak Walton has always
been a favorite with readers, and his “Lives” have held
a prominent place among choice books. The most extravagant
admiration has been expressed for them by men
of the finest genius. Wordsworth says, in not the least
beautiful of his sonnets, that</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='line0'>—“The feather whence the pen</p>
<p class='line0'>Was shaped, that traced the lives of these good men,</p>
<p class='line0'>Dropt from an angel’s wing.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We never knew a case where the book was read without
giving delight. Indeed it nestles close to the heart. There
is a quaint, cunning, quiet beauty to it, which wins upon
the mind, and gently forces assent to its excellence. Such
a book is balm to a sensitive and irritable spirit. It is read
with some such feeling as might be excited by a benediction
from Chaucer’s good parson. Every one who desires to
“possess himself in much quietness,” whose brain has
been fretted and stung by the morbid creations of the
Satanic school of letters, should devote his days and nights
to Isaak Walton, as Johnson advised the style-monger to
devote himself to Addison. The sweet serenity which
breathes through the whole book, joined to the sly quaint
beauty of the expression, cannot fail to charm every mind
not wholly debauched by the “storm-and-pressure” style
now in vogue. The men to whom the book relates, are
among the saints of English literature; men who combined
great learning and greater intellect, with sweetness
of disposition and repose of manner. We can hardly conceive
of a reader rising from the perusal of these “Lives”
without having some of their many amenities infused into
his heart.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
